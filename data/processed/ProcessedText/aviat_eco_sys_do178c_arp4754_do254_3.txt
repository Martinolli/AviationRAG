modification replacement article allow manufacturer produce eligible item installation type certify product parts manufacturing approval approval approval manufacturer fabrication inspection system technical standard order device also require applicant obtain parts manufacturing approval since technical standard order design production approval parts manufacturing approval approval obtain replacement part utilize technical standard order device case installer must place modifier name plate technical standard order device part produce time supplemental type certificate field approval eligible parts manufacturing approval standard part nuts bolt require parts manufacturing approval certificate aircraft parts manufacturing approval basis normally require device affect safety instal certify aircraft case experimental aircraft parts manufacturing approval general approval inspection procedure material process parts manufacturing approval approval applicable specific device specific process procedure device manufacturer hold parts manufacturing approval make replacement part though original manufacturer aircraft originally instal item parts manufacturing approval use produce modification part supplemental type certificate supplemental type certificate case supplemental type certificate issue approval supplemental type certificate become basis approval modify part parts manufacturing approval modify part issue shortly supplemental type certificate issue parts manufacturing approval increase importance travel proliferate evolve aircraft owner operator want hold hostage single supplier life aircraft want alternate source part conversely certification authority recognize aircraft safety resemble large complex chain safety weak link within chain unapproved part could readily become weak link affect safety obtain parts manufacturing approval normally require distinct sequential activity depict three methods obtaining approval parts manufacturing approval part design method parts manufacturing approval identical show evidence licensing agreement separate approval method actually mean substantiate identically often method use obtain parts manufacturing approval supplemental type certificate licensing agreement case parts manufacturing approval applicant establish licensing agreement type certificate supplemental type certificate technical standard order holder type design type certificate supplemental type certificate technical standard order use substantiate identically method parts manufacturing approval identical without licensing agreement case applicant submit statement certify design identical respect approve design generally applicant access original design case complex sophisticated part nearly impossible obtain parts manufacturing approval identically without license agreement method parts manufacturing approval computation method sound comprehensive computation demonstrate compliance applicable worthiness standard sequential activity obtain parts manufacturing approval describe step prove safe design part manufacture must first show safe design airworthy safe design show remember avionic certification prove innocence unlike typical law aviation safety predicate upon guilty prove innocent paradigm parts manufacturing approval applicant must prove design safe proving applicable certification regulation standard follow depend upon part example combination software hardware environmental testing apply along advisory circular possibly requirement lack licensing agreement method additional analysis use show part acceptable simple design analysis could inspection part comparison similar approve part show part safety attribute already approve part complex design analysis could calculation directly prove part meet federal aviation administration safety standard note part contain hardware software logic analysis could use replace option invalid step obtaining production approval conforming step accept next step obtain actual production approval part step necessary design already show safe standard regulation simple consider healthy lifestyle person recipe healthy exercise stress reduction sleep own recipe hardly guarantee implementation live healthy lifestyle require diligence time money junk binge true safe aviation part manufacturer must prove follow safe design able manufacture consistently provision defect detection prevention process proof combine defect detection prevention quality assurance function whereby prove conformance ensure part ship user requirement approve design regulation standard parts manufacturing approval transfer valid surrender withdraw terminate usually certify agency parts manufacturing approval sell usually license mention buyer automatically receive permission produce simple latter character parts manufacturing approval stand manufacturing approval manufacturing process facility quality assurance ecosystem must first approve buyer parts manufacturing approval license obligate obtain parts manufacturing approval though easy procure license design previously parts manufacturing approval additional note regard parts manufacturing approval summarize note regard parts manufacturing approval parts manufacturing approval thus form important part worthiness pyramid since great emphasis place manufacturer quality system

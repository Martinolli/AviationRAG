Title: Quality management systems — Fundamentals and vocabulary Author(s): international standard organization Category: Regulation Tags: Quality, Management, System, Vocabulary Introduction This International Standard provides the fundamental concepts, principles, and vocabulary for quality management systems (QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM) and the foundation for other QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM standards. This International Standard is intended to help the user understand the fundamental concepts, principles, and vocabulary of quality management in order to be able to effectively and efficiently implement a QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM and realize value from other QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM standards. This International Standard proposes a well-defined QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM based on a framework that integrates established fundamental concepts, principles, processes, and resources related to quality in order to help organizations realize their objectives. It is applicable to all organizations, regardless of size, complexity, or business model. It aims to increase an organization’s awareness of its duties and commitment to fulfilling its customers' and interested parties' needs and expectations and achieving satisfaction with its products and services. This International Standard contains seven quality management principles supporting the fundamental concepts described in 2.2. In 2.3, for each quality management principle, there is a “statement” describing each principle, a “rationale” explaining why the organization would address the principle, “key benefits” that are attributed to the principles, and “possible actions” that an organization can take in applying the principle. This International Standard contains the terms and definitions that apply to all quality management and QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM standards developed by the INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION/TC 176 and other sector-specific QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM standards based on those standards at the time of publication. The terms and definitions are arranged in conceptual order, with an alphabetical index provided at the end of the document. Annex A includes a set of diagrams of the concept systems that form the concept order. Scope This International Standard describes the fundamental concepts and principles of quality management, which are universally applicable to the following: — organizations seeking sustained success through the implementation of a quality management system; — customers seeking confidence in an organization’s ability to consistently provide products and services conforming to their requirements; — organizations seeking confidence in their supply chain that product and service requirements will be met; — organizations and interested parties seeking to improve communication through a common understanding of the vocabulary used in quality management; — organizations performing conformity assessments against the requirements of INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION 9001; — providers of training, assessment or advice in quality management; — developers of related standards. This International Standard specifies the terms and definitions that apply to all quality management and quality management system standards developed by INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION/TC 176. 2 Fundamental concepts and quality management principles 2.1 General The quality management concepts and principles described in this International Standard give the organization the capacity to meet challenges presented by an environment that is profoundly different from recent decades. The context in which an organization works today is characterized by accelerated change, the globalization of markets, and the emergence of knowledge as a principal resource. The impact of quality extends beyond customer satisfaction; it can also directly impact the organization’s reputation. Society hardware accomplishment summary become better educated and more demanding, making interested parties increasingly more influential. By providing fundamental concepts and principles to be used in the development of a quality management system (QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM), this International Standard provides a way of thinking about the organization more broadly. All concepts, principles, and their interrelationships should be seen as a whole and not in International Standard Organizationlation of each other. No individual concept or principle is more important than another. At any one time, finding the right balance in application is critical. Fundamental Concepts 2.2.1 Quality An organization focused on quality promotes a culture that results in the behavior, attitudes, activities, and processes that deliver value through fulfilling the needs and expectations of customers and other relevant interested parties. The quality of an organization’s products and services is determined by the ability to satisfy customers and the intended and unintended impact on relevant interested parties. The quality of products and services includes their intended function and performance and their perceived value and benefit to the customer. 2.2.2 Quality Management System A QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM comprises activities by which the organization identifies its objectives and determines the processes and resources required to achieve desired results. The QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM manages the interacting processes and resources required to provide value and realize results for relevant interested parties. The QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM enables top management to optimize the use of resources considering the long and short-term consequences of their decision. A QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM provides the means to identify actions to address the intended and unintended consequences of providing products and services. 2.2.3 Context of an organization Understanding the context of the organization is a process. This process determines factors that influence the organization’s purpose, objectives, and sustainability. It considers internal factors such as the organization's values, culture, knowledge, and performance. It also considers external factors such as legal, technological, competitive, market, cultural, social, and economic environments. Examples of how an organization’s purpose can be expressed include its vision, mission, policies, and objectives. 2.2.4 Interested Parties The concept of interested parties extends beyond a focus solely on the customer. It is important to consider all relevant interested parties. Part of understanding the organization's context is identifying its interested parties. The relevant interested parties provide a significant risk to organizational sustainability if their needs and expectations are unmet. Organizations define what results are necessary to deliver to those relevant interested parties to reduce that risk. Organizations attract, capture, and retain the support of the relevant interested parties they depend upon for their success. 2.2.5 Support 2.2.5.1 General Top management support of the QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM and engagement of people enables: — provision of adequate human and other resources; — monitoring processes and results; determining and evaluating of risks and opportunities; — implementing appropriate actions. Responsible acquisition, deployment, maintenance, enhancement, and disposal of resources support the organization in achieving its objectives. 2.2.5.2 People People are essential resources within the organization. The organization is performance depends on how people behave within the system in which they work. Within an organization, people become engaged and aligned through a common understanding of the quality policy and the organization’s desired results. 2.2.5.3 Competence A QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM is most effective when all employees understand and apply the skills, training, education, and experience needed to perform their roles and responsibilities. Top management is responsible for providing opportunities for people to develop these necessary competencies. 2.2.5.4 Awareness is attained when people understand their responsibilities and how their actions contribute to achieving the organization’s objectives. 2.2.5.5 Communication Planned and effective internal (i.e., throughout the organization) and external (i.e., with relevant interested parties) communication enhances people’s engagement and increased understanding of the context of the organization, the needs and expectations of customers and other relevant interested parties, and the QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. 2.3 Quality management principles 2.3.1 Customer focus 2.3.1.1 Statement The primary focus of quality management is to meet customer requirements and strive to exceed customer expectations. 2.3.1.2 Rationale Sustained success is achieved when an organization attracts and retains the confidence of customers and other relevant interested parties.

It often involves multiple types and sources of inputs and their interpretation, which can be subjective. It is important to understand cause-and-effect relationships and potential unintended consequences. Facts, evidence, and data analysis lead to greater objectivity and confidence in decision-making. 2.3.6.3 Key benefits Some potential key benefits are: — improved decision-making processes; improved assessment of process performance and ability to achieve objectives; — improved operational effectiveness and efficiency; — increased ability to review, challenge, and change opinions and decisions; — increased ability to demonstrate the effectiveness of past decisions. 2.3.6.4 Possible actions include: — determine, measure, and monitor key indicators to demonstrate the organization’s performance; — make all data needed available to the relevant people; — ensure that data and information are sufficiently accurate, reliable and secure; — analyze and evaluate data and information using suitable methods; — ensure people are competent to analyze and evaluate data as needed; — make decisions and take actions based on evidence, balanced with experience and intuition. 2.3.7 Relationship management 2.3.7.1 Statement For sustained success, organizations manage their relationships with relevant interested parties, such as providers. 2.3.7.2 Rationale Relevant interested parties influence the performance of an organization. Sustained success is more likely to be achieved when the organization manages relationships with all of its interested parties to optimize their impact on its performance. Relationship management with its provider and partner networks is of particular importance. 2.3.7.3 Key benefits Some potential key benefits are: — enhanced performance of the organization and its relevant interested parties through responding to the opportunities and constraints related to each interested party; — a common understanding of objectives and values among interested parties; — the increased capability to create value for interested parties by sharing resources and competence and managing quality-related risks; — a well-managed supply chain that provides a stable flow of products and services. 2.3.7.4 Possible actions include: — determine relevant interested parties (such as providers, partners, customers, investors, employees, or society as a whole) and their relationship with the organization; — determine and prioritize interested party relationships that need to be managed; establish relationships that balance short-term gains with long-term considerations; — gather and share information, expertise, and resources with relevant interested parties; — measure performance and provide performance feedback to interested parties, as appropriate, to enhance improvement initiatives; — establish collaborative development and improvement activities with providers, partners and other interested parties; — encourage and recognize improvements and achievements by providers and partners. 2.4 Developing the QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM using fundamental concepts and principles 2.4.1 QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM model 2.4.1.1 General Organizations share many characteristics with humans as living and learning social organisms. Both are adaptive and comprise interacting systems, processes, and activities. In order to adapt to their varying context, each needs the ability to change. Organizations often innovate to achieve breakthrough improvements. An organization’s QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM model recognizes that not all systems, processes, and activities can be predetermined; therefore, it needs to be flexible and adaptable within the complexities of the organizational context. 2.4.1.2 System Organizations seek to understand the internal and external context to identify the needs and expectations of relevant interested parties. This information is used in the development of the QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM to achieve organizational sustainability. The outputs from one process can be the inputs into other processes and are interlinked into the overall network. Although often comprised of similar processes, each organization and its QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM is unique. 2.4.1.3 Processes The organization hardware accomplishment summary processes that can be defined, measured, and improved. These processes interact to deliver results consistent with the organization’s objectives and cross-functional boundaries. Some processes can be critical, while others are not. Processes have interrelated activities with inputs to deliver outputs. 2.4.1.4 Activity People collaborate within a process to carry out their daily activities. Some activities are prescribed and depend on an understanding of the objectives of the organization, while others are not and react to external stimuli to determine their nature and execution. 2.4.2 Development of a QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM A QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM is a dynamic system that evolves through periods of improvement. Every organization hardware accomplishment summary quality management activities, whether formally planned or not. This International Standard provides guidance on how to develop a formal system to manage these activities. It is necessary to determine activities that already exist in the organization and their suitability in terms of the context of the organization. This International Standard, along with INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION 9004 and INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION 9001, can then be used to assist the organization in developing a cohesive QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. A formal QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM provides a framework for planning, executing, monitoring, and improving the performance of quality management activities. The QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM does not need to be complicated; it needs to accurately reflect the organization's needs. In developing the QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, this International Standard's fundamental concepts and principles can provide valuable guidance. QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM planning is not a singular event; rather, it is an ongoing process. Plans evolve as the organization learns and circumstances change. A plan considers all the organization's quality activities and ensures that it covers all guidance of this International Standard and requirements of INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION 9001. The plan is implemented upon approval. It is important for an organization to regularly monitor and evaluate both the implementation of the plan and the performance of the QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. Carefully considered indicators facilitate these monitoring and evaluation activities. Auditing is a means of evaluating the effectiveness of the QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM to identify risks and determine the fulfillment of requirements. In order for audits to be effective, tangible and intangible evidence needs to be collected. Actions are taken for correction and improvement based upon analysis of the evidence gathered. The knowledge gained could lead to innovation, taking the QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM performance to higher levels. 2.4.3 QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM standards, other management systems, and excellence models The approaches to a QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM described in QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM standards developed by INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION/TC 176, in other management system standards, and organizational excellence models are based on common principles. They all enable an organization to identify risks and opportunities and contain guidance for improvement. In the current context, many issues, such as innovation, ethics, trust, and reputation, could be regarded as parameters within the QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. Standards related to quality management (e.g., INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION 9001), environmental management (e.g., INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION 14001), and energy management (e.g., INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION 50001), as well as other management standards and organizational excellence models, have addressed this. The QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM standards developed by the INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION/TC 176 provide a comprehensive set of requirements and guidelines for a QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION 9001 specifies requirements for a QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION 9004 provides guidance on a wide range of QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM objectives for sustainable success and improved performance. Guidelines for components of a QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM include INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION 10001, INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION 10002, INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION 10003, INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION 10004, INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION 10008, INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION 10012, and INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION 19011. Guidelines for technical subjects in support of a QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM include INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION 10005, INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION 10006, INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION 10007, INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION 10014, INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION 10015, INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION 10018, and INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION 10019. Technical reports in support of a QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM include INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION/TR 10013 and INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION/TR 10017. Requirements for a QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM are also provided in sector-specific standards, such as the International Organization for Standardization/ISO 16949. The various parts of an organization’s management system, including its QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, can be integrated into a single management system. The objectives, processes, and resources related to quality, growth, funding, profitability, environment, occupational health and safety, energy, security, and other aspects of the organization can be more effectively and efficiently achieved and used when the QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM is integrated with other management systems. The organization can perform an integrated audit of its management system against the requirements of multiple International Standards, such as INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION 9001, INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION 14001, INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION/IEC 27001, and INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION 50001. NOTE: The INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION handbook “The Integrated Use of Management System Standards” can provide useful guidance. 3 Terms and definitions 3.1 Terms related to person or people 3.1.1 Top management person or group of people who directs and controls an organization (3.2.1) at the highest level Note 1 to entry: Top management hardware accomplishment summary the power to delegate authority and provide resources within the organization.

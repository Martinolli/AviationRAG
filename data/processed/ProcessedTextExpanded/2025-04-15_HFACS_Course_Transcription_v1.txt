Title: Human Factors Analysis and Classification System – Course Transcription Autho(s): Scott A. Shappell Category: Human Factor Tags: Human, Factor, Analysis, System, Taxonomy 1 - Unsafe Acts Hello welcome to the lectures on the human factors analysis and classification system this is going to be a series of three lectures the first one on the unsafe acts that operators would commit the second lecture will be on the preconditions that set up those failures and the third and final lecture will be a shorter version a short lecture which will include supervisory failures and organizational failures and what I'm going to rtca document (“document order”) is lay these out it's about three hours or so and this first one we're gonna get started right now so without further ado keep in mind that the human factors analysis and classification system er will refer to as H facts human factor analysis and classification sytems facts was the foundation was really continuing airworthines management exposition from a book that Jim Rison wrote several years ago in Exodus published in 1990 where he took some ideas from people like Heinrich and others that had proposed this idea that you know accidents causation is a cascade of events essentially if you will what Jim was saying is that when we look at accidents we tend to focus only on the unsafe acts of operators things that people rtca document (“document order”) wrong and in doing so we kind of missed the bigger picture and for instance I like to give the example all the time of the car accidents that I've had in my past or and as you'll find out throughout the course that I kind of draw my own experiences and the accidents that I've had in the errors that I've committed and one classic was about I guess seven years ago now in the kind of right around the 2004 timeframe I had my second car accident in my life my first one was when I was a teenager and was a little overzealous if you will but the second one actually occurred on a November evening nothing really going on it was about 7 o'clock at night I was exiting our subdivision and I've done this several hundreds of times in fact if you look at the subdivision and you go around in and you realize there's probably what about 50 homes in there and let's just assume well the subdivision have been in existence for about 10 years and you've got 50 homes and people are going in and out of there hundreds of times throughout the day never been an accident prior to mine at that intersection and there hasn't been one sense to the best of my knowledge and now I don't live there anymore but I haven't heard of any and here's what essentially happened it was pretty straightforward basically what happened was this I the way it's set up is that if you can imagine having an exit coming to a stop sign I have a stop sign and then there's another road that goes north-south actually that I tee into and this road that goes north-south as I want to say around a 50 55 mile an hour speed limit and there is no stop sign for them it's a stop sign only for me you look left you look right you look left whatever and then in this particular case I was gonna be driving south so I was turning laughs so I hit across traffic go around into the lane the left lane and go around about my way and I've done this hundreds of times because that's the same way I would go around to work every day and but this one night was a little different because this time I thought I looked both directions but apparently I didn't because when I pulled out I pulled right out in front of a young lady driving her daddy's car and she hit me right in the driver's side door kaboom it was an ugly night you know we had it was massive damage to both cars airbag deploys nobody gets hurt which is the blessing of this whole story but the truth is that I had pulled out into oncoming traffic and what was interesting is the police officer the state trooper continuing airworthines management exposition out to rtca document (“document order”) the investigation he was out there for about an hour comes back to me a little about an hour later and we're sitting there myself and young lady and we've been chatting exchanging information things like that and then almost apologetically the police officer comes up to me and says sir I'm gonna have to issue you a citation a ticket because I've determined after my investigation that the cause of this accident are you ready for this the cause of the accident was driver me failed to yield to oncoming traffic the young lady well decision altitude yeah I pulled out in front of her I clearly admitted that I had made a mistake now there were no other cause factors this was the culmination of this hour-long investigation of which he took a statement for myself and from the young lady now the problem with that is how rtca document (“document order”) you fix that how rtca document (“document order”) you fix that problem you know because I'm probably not the only one in that year that pulled out into you know failed to yield oncoming traffic if you look at the Oklahoma City metro area that year you'll probably find out that hundreds maybe thousands of people have done the same thing some of which may have resulted in fatalities and if your job is to prevent that from happening again what rtca document (“document order”) you rtca document (“document order”) well the typical individuals that I posed that question to will tell they'll give you all these ideas well let's put a stop light up Oh wonderful that's a great idea except that you know if you put a stop light at that one I mean there's never been an accident there before there hasn't been one sense to the best of my knowledge you'd also there are other three subdivisions along that one-mile stretch that don't have stoplights either would you put one in each of those intersections I mean after all it would presumably solve the problem but is it warranted is the cost-benefit well you say well it might prevent a death yes but at what cost I mean and I'm not trying to put cost on on severity but the truth of the matter is I'm not sure that would have solved anything and but then again let's look at it even bigger some people say well let's send it back to training obviously he's forgotten how to drive so listening back to driver's ed so you could have put me in a room with a bunch of teenagers learning how to drive because I've had a car accident that doesn't make sense either what was suspended license that's what we'll rtca document (“document order”) we'll take away his license because if the penalty was levied and large enough people would never rtca document (“document order”) it well that as soon as I was motivated to rtca document (“document order”) it in the first place that it wasn't an accident that I was in fact trying to get out in front or something maybe I was I saw her coming I thought I could make it that might solve that but simply punishing me for an accident an honest mistake you'll find out later that that doesn't solve anything in fact what Jim reason would say in his book and others Heinrich and others said you have to look higher in the system we have to look at the preconditions for those unsafe acts what was different about me that night than any other night I've been driving and if you ask the right questions you'd find out that a lot was different in fact would it if you asked right you find out that I just had an argument with my wife yeah now if you've been married we've all had arguments we like to refer to them as loud discussions in our family I mean the truth of the matter is we all argue because that's healthy and that's what we rtca document (“document order”) as married couples you argue and you make up in life is good that's why we're married because if you're not arguing you're not married you're simply living together and that's well you know the point here is that we all argue that's part of socialization and we were arguing over who is going to take my ten-year-old daughter to require recital yeah it was a Thursday night I just come off a trip there's a football game on I don't want to go around to No I mean if you like listening to people whip cats you love ten-year-old choir recitals I don't like that I'm kind of normal when it comes to that but we all rtca document (“document order”) it you know you got it you take your daughter and you listen to them and it's like ah and then she comes up you say oh you were the best sounding clear air turbulence daughter you sounded great it's part of what we rtca document (“document order”) as adults as parents we have to say things to make everybody and that's what we rtca document (“document order”) it's important and I understand that and like many of the arguments I've had over the last 20 years with my wife more often than I don't win and you know you think I would learn but the truth is in this case I shouldn't have won because the truth is that I did need to spend more time with my family and she did make sense but that didn't make it any better or more palatable to me as a result I'm angry I'm frustrated but I put my daughter in my wife's SUV and we're driving down the road I'm mad and I'm saying things I shouldn't be saying and all of a sudden I'm not paying attention I don't look both wasn't it's that quick thank goodness nobody got hurt it could have been a lot worse so now what could we rtca document (“document order”) to prevent that well we know now more so just knowing what was different about me that night well what was different was I was angry I was frustrated I wasn't paying attention I might have been a little bit tired because I just continuing airworthines management exposition off a trip the point of the matter is that now I'm starting to get a better understand of how to fix the problem it's not as easy as simply saying well we're just gonna go around out and increase the fines because believe me punishment had didn't even cross my mind the thought that I would even have an accident didn't even cross my mind I mean go around figure Jim Riza said you know sometimes we even have to look higher sometimes it's not at the organ is it's not at the individual level it's higher in the system at the supervisory or organizational level because think about this as a supervisor can you believe supervisors can set you up for failure absolutely they can I would submit to you my wife is my supervisor ergo there you have part of problem but no I'm just kidding of course the truth of the matter is that yeah if I'm let's say I'm the commanding officer of a squadron of fighter pilots and I send two guys two knuckleheads two people can barely fly their way out of a box on a mission at night in the weather low-level under 200 feet off the ground to put bombs on who knows what and they don't come back is anybody surprised no they were not going as they could barely fly anyways but wait a minute I had two other pilots that were perfectly successful they had done this before they pull in that mission before they know exactly how to rtca document (“document order”) it they were experienced at all the talent in the world why did I choose those two people that I knew probably couldn't be as successful rather than these two over here that's the sort of thing we're talking about because the supervisors it's our job to provide people the opportunity to succeed we have to bribe people the opportunity to rtca document (“document order”) well and if we don't match up people correctly and we put the wrong people on the wrong job if we don't provide people the expertise they need to succeed guess what they don't and is anybody surprised at the end Jim we even go around a little bit further so you know sometimes we even have to look higher we have to look at the organizational tier sometimes it's the very highest levels of the organization that will set us up for failure things like oh I don't know CEOs vice presidents presidents at most generals these are the people that actually make the big decisions and they can set you up to because they make decisions on hiring practices they make decisions on pay they make decisions on what operations we're going to rtca document (“document order”) they make the big decisions and those can have a tremendous impact downstream anybody that's spent any time in industrial organizational psychology understands that you know if I make decisions that reduce my workforce we're going to downsize because of the economy so I'm going to reduce my workforce that doesn't mean that I'm not going to keep putting out the product I start to put out the product but now people have to work more for less we're gonna rtca document (“document order”) more with less we're gonna downsize we're going to optimize we're gonna streamline yeah what that means is you're gonna work harder because we're getting rid of some people now but we still got to get the same job done and now that hardware accomplishment summary a trickle-down effect and now I may have no choice as a supervisor but to pair those two knuckleheads together that night to fly that low-level mission they don't have the appropriate train they're not qualified and consequently we have a problem it's the problem at the pointy end of the spear is at the operator or sit higher in the system is that where the fix should be so we look at these things and Jim says you know you have to look at outside influences inputs things like that things that would address or impact your performance overall but you don't have control over things like the economy politics things like that we can't control the weather I can't control the weather it just exists I couldn't control the fact that it was a dust that night that I had my car accident it just existed well when we look at that and this whole system we can notice that there are these failures in the the so called holes in the Swiss cheese and what you find out very quickly is that these holes these failure points if we only knew what they were we could fix them we could plug them up and I could plug them up I could prevent an action from happening wouldn't that be the coolest thing in the world yeah so if Jim simply wrote the second book human error to the toast with the holes of the cheese were we could prevent it from happening but you know what he didn't write the book he did and as safety officers it's our job to prevent actions from happening again so what are you gonna rtca document (“document order”) because if I can't plug up the holes the next thing you know these things line up just right and we have an accident and now we're out with a different height above touchdown on instead of our safety height above touchdown on we've got our accident investigator height above touchdown on and now this is ugly because we got somebody dead or badly injured wouldn't it be better if I could tell you what those holes were so you can plug them up well I can we wrote the book a few years later it took us about four or five years we were sitting on a goldmine of data we had every accident in the US Navy and Marine Corps since the very first ones yeah and we static air temperature down and we systematically analyzed him and we identified using that data the holes in the cheese now we sense replicated this many times across multiple industries H faxes used not only a military aviation but then it kind of grew into civilian aviation we got into commercial aviation so now all the airlines reason so not only were militaries around the world using H fax but now commercial airlines were in them when commercial airlines brought it on board the next thing you knew now l said a mining starts using it petrochemical starts using it medicine starts using it even Disney was using it so this this system this model that we had put together based on gyms or original ideas and kind of blossomed into this animal that although it's modified a little bit for each of the different organizations generally is the same fundamental principles that I'm about to show you and so what I want to rtca document (“document order”) is walk you through first in this first module the unsafe acts of operators and by the way I'll acknowledge that on the left here in the picture is --kavitha arm she is a an engineer at GE energy up in Greenville and next to her is Katie berry one of my doctoral students who's get her degree here very shortly in 2010 and she did quite a bit of work with GE and that's the top of a winter with those big wind turbines you see there at the top of a wind turbine with someone taking a picture of him so it's pretty cool beautiful picture so you can see the wind turbines in the back so there you go around so now you know you're gonna be seeing the rest of time here but what I want to rtca document (“document order”) back to the real point of this is I want to talk about errors and violations and when we go around in and we look at the unsafe acts of offers you can generally break them down into two overall classes you've got this class of honest mistakes or errors that you and I make every day we're constantly making errors and then we have this other group would call violations the willful disregard for the rules and regulations and the key word is willful I knew what the rules were and for whatever reason I elected not to follow them they didn't matter to me I didn't need them okay well let's take a look at those a little closer so within Arizona stakes you and I make every day we really have three types decision errors skill based errors and perceptual errors and let's go around over each one so decision errors the real key point here that I want you to remember about decision errors is these are conscious things these are things we think about think about in fact I like to refer to them as thinking errors okay so we have this I'll even say Gosa federal aviation regulation to call these thinking just put the thinking errors so the idea here with these thinking errors is that when we make decisions they're based on three very important criteria one is information rtca document (“document order”) I have good information because if I have good information I'm more likely to make a reasonable or good decision number two rtca document (“document order”) I have the knowledge to deal with that information in other words rtca document (“document order”) I understand what this information really is I mean I put you in front of a aerospace information report traffic control screen and say okay I want you to make the decision on how close these planes if they're on the right vector and if they're at the right altitude in that they're not gonna collide with each other I mean you're like I gave you all the great improv it's right there every piece of information you need is right there it's state of the art but you would have the ability to make that decision because you don't understand the information so you have to have knowledge of that and then the third component is experience because with experience comes the ability to make a good a better decision but sometimes experience can work against you let me just give you some examples here just to kind of bring it into focus let's take you know we ought most of us have children at some point and you're gonna find out for those of you that don't have kids that children are entertainment that's why we have kids children are pure entertainment for adults it's it's for us and I gotta be honest with you my kids I have two daughters my one is 18 the other one is 12 right now and they're growing up but when they were younger they were wonderful not that they're not wonderful now but they were fantastic they were fun because sending my wife when we when we had our children Cindy was a stay-at-home mom and she she taught them everything and they're wonderful and at age four was about that time when she started letting them dress themselves which was pure entertainment because Cindy could call up to him on a cold winter out of mourning and say Kim my eldest when she was four would say Kim make sure you dress warmly today it's going to be snowing outside now that's excellent information so good information but a four year old doesn't have any knowledge on how to deal with that information so the entertainment value was she would come bounding down the steps and you had no idea what she was gonna be wearing she could be in shorts and a t-shirt she could be in a bathing suit she could have on you know some sort of princess robe she could have clothes adult match it was pure entertainment because while she had good information she didn't have the knowledge to handle it nor the experience but then after a couple years of training and you know working with her now as sim when it was time for first grade and Cindy would call up to Erin or quechua Kim and say Kim make sure you dress warmly today it's going to be snowing it was never a problem the fun was gone because she would come bounding down the stairs she would have on some sort of long pants a long shirt she'd have on her snow boots she would be prepared so we didn't have to watch her anymore so for the next several years we didn't watch her at all you just called up he said Kim it's gonna be rain it's gonna be hot it's gonna be cold it's can be stolen and she continuing airworthines management exposition down dressed appropriately but then about age 15 things you have to start watching her again right because she's dressing for other experiences and so mom and dad are little more aware yeah now that's the same truth that we see in industry any industry when a new hire when you hire someone new off the street whether they have experience in that field or not you watch them and we watch them real close they're on a kind of a probationary period where we're trying to make sure we're teaching them they're not we're giving that a knowledge to deal with the information that they're going to be receiving so that it's dealt with the way we wanted to receive it and and and deal with it because think about it this way when you go around to your new job those of you that are in this class probably some of you may already be employed some of you may be looking for jobs after this you're going to be very knowledgeable and you're gonna have a knowledge of basic understanding but when you go around to your new job there's going to be a way they want you to rtca document (“document order”) it you know if you're going to work for General Electric they want you to rtca document (“document order”) the GE way if you're going to work for Delta Airlines they want you to rtca document (“document order”) it the delta way and so it's not as easy as just simply saying ah you've got the knowledge go around rtca document (“document order”) it there's there's a training period a trial period if you will so after about a year you've now learned how to rtca document (“document order”) it their way and make decisions appropriately based on the information that's being given to you and you gain a little bit of experience and life is really good and so for the next several years we don't really watch you but you know what you're gonna find out that yeah after about five six seven years you start to get complacent you start to take shortcuts and rtca document (“document order”) things differently not quite a standard way you make non-standard decisions and as a result this can lead us to real serious problems so these are conscious decisions based on three important things information knowledge and experience well so those are the thinking errors so if we have thinking errors let's just take a look at the next one we also have doing errors doing so let's call these I know it's a bad English but let's call these doing errors all right so we had thinking and then we have doing so these doing there's these skill based errors when you develop a skill you could these are things we can rtca document (“document order”) without thinking I can write my name without thinking I can talk to you and write my name so I can say hey you know my name is sky and so on and so forth and blah blah blah I can write and talk at the same time I can drive a car and talk at the same time because it's a highly practice skill when you know when you think about it when I'm driving down the road I don't think about push on the accelerator tapping on the brake there's small tiny Corrections I make to the steering wheel I just rtca document (“document order”) it right these are doing it you don't have when I type on a keyboard I don't have to think about where my fingers go around they just kind of go around doesn't mean I didn't intend to type it just means I don't have to think about it so highly practice skills like writing your name like typing on a keyboard are things we rtca document (“document order”) without thinking walking going opening doors you open the door we all know how to open the door now but you know what when you were one-year-old you had no clue but over years you've learned how to open doors you've developed this skill I don't have to think about how rtca document (“document order”) I open this door rtca document (“document order”) I pull it what rtca document (“document order”) I rtca document (“document order”) no you just rtca document (“document order”) it now the problem with these skill based behaviors is you often fall prey to attention failures memory failures and technique here so let me give you some examples attention failure we've all had this happen you're driving down the road you're having a conversation with a friend or a colleague or somebody or you got the kids in the back and you got conversation and you got the radio up and you're not paying attention and you go around blasting right by your exit you know you meant to get off and actually you just you weren't paying attention how many of you have walked into an elevator you'd push the UP button you get in the elevator it's going down the door is open you're just so used to because it's what you rtca document (“document order”) you want graham book oh shoot it's going the wrong direction well I guess I'll just write it through or have you it let's go around back to the door you think I'll open a door simple everybody opens the door how many times if you went up to the door and you thought it pushed out or pulled in and you just went the wrong direction it's like boom oh geez sorry yeah it happens you're just used to the door pushing out but this one actually then happen here at Freeman Hall here at Clemson we're on the weekend they lock the doors and I'm not used to the doors being locked and so I was trying to and normally because I'm a tall guy I tend to push you could see my paw print on the front door because I pushed on the door I don't push on the handle down here lower I'm just lazy and I push on the glass and it was locked and I'm got to get out I'm in a hurry boom thank goodness is strong glass I would put my hand right through the glass because it was locked it wasn't going anywhere because the skill I had developed the doing aerospace information report I developed I didn't have to worry about pushing the bar down there to get the door open but it was locked that weekend so we look at that we look at memory failures you know forgetting items in a checklist this happens to us all the time you know that's part of this this issue is that you know we work with checklists all the time and sometimes we forget steps yeah happens it's it's because it's automatic I mean have you ever forgot have you ever locked yourself out of your car yeah have you locked yourself out of your house have you ever forgotten to pack something sure you have yeah it happens it's not criminal we forget things all the time but let me let me ask you this and this is really an important data point if somebody forgets a critical item in a checklist let's say they forget to put a we call it lockout tagout in industry they forget to put a sign saying that this particular piece of equipment is energized or not energized in other words there's a lecture there power coming to it let's say that you forgot to put the sign up saying that it's energized in other words kind of a warning you just forgot you're supposed to but you're not and now somebody goes up thinking that it's not energized that it's off that the fuse hardware accomplishment summary been pulled and they stick and they get zapped and let's say they get killed what rtca document (“document order”) you think the company is going to rtca document (“document order”) to the individual that was supposed to put that sign up that just simply forgot if you say probably terminate him you're probably right but let me ask you this imagine if life were like that that every time you forgot something an item in a checklist you were treated like you were on the job so let's say now instead of you know forgetting to put that warning sign up that the piece of equipments energized now instead you free lock yourself out of your house well guess what how's that true air temperature, or total air temperature working out you'll never live in a home again oh you lock yourself out of your car you'll never drive again how's that bike working out oh you say you forgot to pack something you'll never travel again the point I'm trying to make here is that you can't punish your way out of these types of errors you can I mean if it makes you feel better because you punish somebody you fired him or whatever go around ahead but that's not going to solve it and prevent it from happening again it will happen again I guarantee it because it's the manner in which they forgot and/or though it's a type of error committed it's not an error of volition it's not intentional it's not motivational it's an issue that they simply forgot it's a normal human behavior we forget things all the time all the time you can't punish your way out even if you threaten people with life if you forget to if you forget to pick up the milk on the way home you will be killed after a period of time it doesn't matter you still forget it hardware accomplishment summary nothing to rtca document (“document order”) with motivation I didn't intend to forget so we can talk about that at another time but the point I'm trying to make here is that the fixes are very different than what you're thinking or the traditional fix we talked about technique errors simply the way we rtca document (“document order”) things can affect the way we perform if we start talking about things like you know my technique I mean if I look at everybody let's take 20 random people and let's put them in a car everybody drives differently some drive fast some drive slow some Drive rules scary some Drive very cautiously some people are very aggressive and some people are very passive everybody drives differently it doesn't mean you don't know how to drive it doesn't mean you don't have a skill to drive it's just everybody does it a little bit different and I would the case in point the example I give everybody is northern drivers in the US come two southern drivers in the US in the north when we get all the seasons we get rain we get snow we get any kind of weather condition you can think of we've learned to drive in those conditions in the way you drive in those conditions as you tend to put distance between your vehicles so you have this is a safe driving distance of if this person stops on the dime we can slow down we got plenty of time it's not so southern drivers can get between us I met my wife in the when I was in flight training down in Pensacola and I will tell you she drives completely differently than I am she learned how to drive in the south and in the south where it's always sunny and dry and it's beautiful all the time they don't have to worry about having a safety margin a distance because dry pavement they got plenty of time to stop so they tend to drive nose to tail you know it's the home of NASCAR and all so you got these they drive like race car drivers they're right on the tail of the guy in front of them kind of like they're drafting kinda like they're saving fuel or something I don't know but they drive differently and I will tell you that I don't know about Southern drivers per se but I can tell you my drive my wife thinks of the horn is a communication device I think of the horn as a emergency device if there's a clear air turbulence in the road I'm off my horn I don't use it unless it's an emergency I don't want to run over the clear air turbulence but if somebody cuts me off I don't talk my horn height above touchdown they know what they've just done it doesn't solve any problems in my view but I can tell you my wife and many of them many of the people I know is someone cut you up put off the horn in fact if somebody cuts me off on my wife's over here just say I'll get them what and I'm like what you mean says I'll get their biggest cut you off well and we get into this discussion for the next five minutes and Frank give us a OK pie yeah well this guy isn't in the FATA me going listen baby better me now for it's five minutes later he doesn't have a clue what I'm by at least I solved the problem the point I'm trying to make is that everybody's techniques are different I can take somebody any of you that have ever driven a rental car you're used to driving your own car and you get in the rental car and guess what happens you go around to turn the lights on the boy Raipur standard terminal arrival routes gone you go around to turn the wiper wipers on and the lights started I mean how many times have you had that happen just because you learned in one environment doesn't mean it translates well to the next and that's the point I'm trying to make techniques you learn in one environment don't necessarily translate well to the next so we have these technique errors the way you rtca document (“document order”) things can set you up for failure so we have thinking errors doing errors and the last one I want to talk about under errors is perceptual error so we have thinking doing and now perceiving errors and we're talking here about the five senses I'm not talking about I misunderstood him no we're talking about using your five senses eyes ears nose taste touch right so vision auditory olfactory taste and touch that's what we're talking about here so when we talk about that we know that we're not really good as good as we think we are at hearing things sometimes we miss hear things sometimes we don't hear anything at all and our brains tend to fill in the gaps we tend to gasp how many times have you been told I told you that and you said no you didn't well maybe they did you just tend to hear it or you didn't hear it clearly or how about this one have you ever looked right at something and not seen it how could you possibly miss it we'll learn later in this course about change blindness and how that happens all the time you know or have you ever been driving with some of the parks by Braille this is a person that doesn't stop till they hit the curb in front of them yeah they pull up and then get ready to park on some point oh yeah because they don't have a good distance or have you ever opened your car door into the car next to you I know what you did you simply shut the car door you backed up you went over three spaces so they wouldn't know it was you they'd hit their car I rtca document (“document order”) the same thing but the point I'm trying to make is you didn't mean to hit the car well how about this one you parked real tight in a shopping center and you turn to your ten-year-old daughter Kim be careful with your car door what's the very next sound you're gonna hear you're right oh because she doesn't mean to rtca document (“document order”) it but you get angry you start yelling at her thinking that she did it somehow purposefully she didn't she misjudged it happens all the time we weren't visually impoverished her auditorially impoverished environments we all see as well as we think we rtca document (“document order”) have you ever been walking down the steps in the evening you think you're on the last one but you got one more to go around have you ever tripped down the stairs at a movie theater it happens have you ever tripped over a crack or something that you didn't even see on the ground when you're walking down the street it happens it's not criminal the point I'm trying to make is those types of errors have very specific fixes just only that if I go around into a company let's say I'd go around into Disney pick one I don't care and we go around in and we say you know what you're number one type of error we've looked at all your data for two years and the number one error form were seen as decision errors with just that much information can we rtca document (“document order”) anything absolutely we can always start to think about the types of interventions to fix thinking errors and what was that well provide better information maybe it's an information issue maybe they're not getting the information they need well or maybe it's they don't have the knowledge so we're going to provide them training in its classroom type training where we're going to bring people in no class and we're going to we're going to give them the information the knowledge they need or maybe it's simply experience now that's something you can only get with time and maybe it's such a thing that what we're going to have to rtca document (“document order”) is basically make sure we have a more experienced workforce when we start downsizing workforces generally speaking we tend to get rid of the more experienced people because they cost more so we offer early retirements and then all of a sudden we're faced with a workforce which had a tremendous reduction in experience and now all these decision errors start popping up so you can see how organizational decisions can lead to bad decision errors at the point of the spear or if I tell you your number one promise skill based errors now what can I rtca document (“document order”) well it may be training again but it's not classroom training it's repetitive training I need to get you practiced up I need you to get you so the skill is evolving it may also mean I to look at are there distractions are there things that are affecting their attention reduce distractions those sorts of things or maybe it's simply an issue that they're forgetting maybe I need to build checklists put in procedures that force them to rtca document (“document order”) certain things whether it's automate or automate things there's a whole host of things that each of these boxes help me rtca document (“document order”) if it's perceptual errors maybe I have to enhance the lighting come up with a better way to put the sound in there's a whole host of things and fixes that each of these boxes correspond to that's critical information that's human factors well so we have the areas of so-called honest mistakes and we talked about the three types but then we have the flip side of the coin now we're not talking about people that are making out of stairs we're talking about the violations of the rules the willful disregard for the rules and regulations these are the evil people right these are the bad people absolutely we got to throw the book at him we'll wait a minute let's this before we go around all high and right let's think about this for a minute how many of you listening this video haven't broken a law in the last week anybody hardware accomplishment summary anybody not broken a rule or a law in the last week well if you're being honest how many of you have actually driven the speed limit accepted route to a higher speed I mean if it says 55 miles an hour on that Highway how fast you go around most of us would probably go around somewhere between 60 and 64 so we go around somewhere between 5 to 9 miles an hour over the speed limit why for three reasons one because we know we can get away with it it's condoned by management so management condones that activity number two everybody does it in fact if you're going 60 and a 55 I guarantee people are passing you in fact if you're going 55 in a 55 I guarantee there are drivers that are using their horn communicating whether you telling you you're not going fast enough and you're gonna hear into the speed lot how many of you hate those guys that drive the exact speed limit 13 oh yeah I'm like you so not only is it condemned my management everybody does it but the third ingredient is it becomes part of your behavior yeah you know the truth is that you probably always speed I don't even know you and I know you always speed you know how I know that you always speed because when the police officers come in the other direction what's the first thing you rtca document (“document order”) you take your foot off the accelerator and you test start tapping on the brake you start slowing down because you know you're a habitual violator you're evil right well of course not you're normal you're absolutely normal let me give you a better example kids I have an 18 year old and a 12 and when she hit I want to say about 16 we let her start dating let me tell you as a father that's the most traumatic time of your life this is not a happy time for a father of a daughter and but the truth is yeah it's part of growing up and so they start dating and so we would tell Kim we want you in at 10 o'clock on Friday night and when Kim got in at 10:15 what are you gonna rtca document (“document order”) if you don't rtca document (“document order”) anything what time does she get in on Saturday night when you tell her to be in a tent you're right she gets in 10:30 if you don't rtca document (“document order”) anything Saturday night what time does she get in next Friday that's later yet 11 o'clock what we call that is basically normalization of deviance and if you think about it this way think about it as here are your rules they're a circle and you've got your child in here okay and this is let's say that's 10 o'clock that circle represents 10 o'clock and so your daughter kind of goes on her date she comes home she goes and she comes home and she's always coming in at 10:00 I'll send one time boom she comes she's out too late she's at 10:15 she comes in she's got a perfect excuse the movie went out later whatever and you don't rtca document (“document order”) anything and then she carries on and she's still you know she's a good kid she gets in a ten but then again all of a sudden boom she comes in at 10:15 again or maybe it's 10 20 and you still don't rtca document (“document order”) anything before you know it she starts staying out till 10 20 10:30 regularly we call this normalization of deviance others write that down normalization station of deviance and what this does is it basically says that that 10 o'clock curfews now went to 10:30 so instead of being 10 we're now at 10:30 now what happens is before you know it eventually she starts exceeding that and before you know it it's just gotten larger and so the rules just keep expanding to a point where it gets out of control and now rather than deal with it when she got in at 10:15 I'm not saying you have to be you have to throw the book at her basically I could go around and which is what we did when it happened to Kim we said okay Kim tomorrow night your curfew is it 8 o'clock you're not gonna be out till 10:00 and she but you know what it only took one time and all I did was cut her curfew back to hours for a weekend it wasn't the end of the world I didn't tell her she would never date and never date again I didn't get I I mean it was very and it everything's fine since then she's been fine if on the other hand I'd waited until she continuing airworthines management exposition in at 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning and now I rtca document (“document order”) have to go around crazy on her and now you have to rtca document (“document order”) things that you don't want to rtca document (“document order”) browning for life sort of thing maybe that is a good thing I don't know but the point is that this normalization of deviance half happens every day you can see it around you all the time people that don't wear proper personal protective gear people that you know are going 60 65 and a 55 or faster it happens now the point is if you enforce the rules people will adhere to them it's a fact it's normal human behavior and my daughter is a little human she would go around just as federal aviation regulation as her parents will let her go around and we're not overly mean or anything but we enforce our rules otherwise they don't exist so we have routine by these so called routine violations and those are different than what we're going to call exceptional violation here we're not talking about going 65 in a 55 mile an hour zone we're talking about going 120 in a 55 mile an hour zone let me give you an example I was a teenager on my way to Wright State for college night basically it was an orientation night as I was going to be going to Wright State and my dad said here take the keys to the Firebird now that's kind of poor planning on my on my dad's part but I did so I had my three buddies and myself we're all going but we're gonna drive the Wright State in Dayton Ohio we're on well I live on the country in Arcanum Ohio this farm community and I'm on a back country road nice and straight for several miles with my three buddies in my dad's sports car what rtca document (“document order”) you think I did yeah well if you get it you probably guessed it yeah I want to see how fast that car will go around I can tell you a 1976 Firebird with that huge engine that huge v8 will go around at least 120 miles an hour you know how rtca document (“document order”) I know that well because that's where the speedometer breaks yeah and let me just tell you something when it's pedometer breaks it doesn't go around back to zero it stays at 120 so you see my dilemma being the young junior rocket side as I was I know my dad was gonna be furious so I figured gee if I go around backwards just as fast as I went forwards it's gonna fix itself nothing happens so I start where my buddies and I were getting tools out we're trying to figure out how can we get under the dash and move that back you can't rtca document (“document order”) it so at that point I did what any good Catholic boy will rtca document (“document order”) at that point I took the car home and I started to make a deal with God we've all been there right oh dear God please if you had this one prayer should I become a priest whatever you want well for those of you that have engaged in that kind of behavior the good Lord doesn't answer every prayer and there's good reasons for that and he certainly didn't answer that one and the next day I got a phone call from my dad and it went something like this now remember this is before cellphones so I got to go around to the principal's office and I'm thinking hey I'm getting an award you know whatever I get up there my dad's on the phone this is how conversation went son rtca document (“document order”) you have anything to tell me no sir said I notice the spammers broke on the Firebird this morning oh that well I'm not a good liar I continuing airworthines management exposition clean my dad asked me a very very simple question the same exact question I've asked several US naval aviators as they static air temperature before myself and other senior naval officers in what we call a field naval aviator evaluation board it's a bad boy board this is worse where a naval aviator hardware accomplishment summary done something very dumb broken a very bad rule and now they're sitting before us and we have to determine their fate well are they gonna fly again and I asked them all the same question the same question my dad asked the question was very simple it went like this son why did you rtca document (“document order”) it now that's a very good question what was my answer what was the answer those naval aviators what was your answer when you were asked I said I don't know that's a good answer I don't know I don't know to this day I can't really explain it now that didn't make my dad very happy just made him angry and those animals had heard that I don't know oh look out but that's a good answer I don't know now you can see well it was peer pressure you had those three buddies in the car right I don't think so I'm not buying that I think I would have done it even if I've been alone well you know he's a bad apple I was a bad kid well had academic scholarships got in everywhere I want I mean I was a good kid I was good Catholic boy I would I was a good guy I was kind of guy I'd let my own daughters go around out with I was a good guy hmm well then how rtca document (“document order”) we predict this frankly it's almost impossible if I could predict these I wouldn't be here talking to you today I'd be making millions of dollars sucking margaritas on a beach somewhere the truth is that when I rtca document (“document order”) accident investigation and I go around out and I identify one of these in an accident somebody as an exceptional violation invariably someone is dead or very seriously injured and if I could predict that and prevent it I would make millions millions I can't I don't know we can talk about excessive risk-taking behavior we talk about personalities all day long believe me it's almost impossible to predict this I've never done it before I haven't done it since the fact of the matter was I had a wild hair I don't understand why but it happened and it's one of the things I fear as a parent all the time because I know that the best kids will go around out and rtca document (“document order”) something really crazy and unfortunately when they when an accident happens it usually ends up in loss of life and this is really tragic so in an industry if you see this if somebody busts the rule like that you have no choice but to throw the book at him to potentially terminate him you may have no choice I had a case where I was dealing with a naval aviator that was a well decorated very well-respected aviator who did something very stupid and was now sitting before that field naval aviator evaluation board and we were determining his faith and when he continuing airworthines management exposition in he basically continuing airworthines management exposition totally clean he admitted everything said he was a fool I don't know what I was thinking I asked you the same question why did you I don't know I wished I could take it back because it was dumb it was a stupidest thing I've ever done but I'm telling you I'll never rtca document (“document order”) it again and I believed it I absolutely believed him everyone in that room the Admiral everybody believed him in fact I made the argument during our deliberations I said you know we need to we need to take this guy embrace him put him back in the cockpit send him around the fleet to tell his story he will be the poster child for safety this guy will never break another rule he'll be the best aviator we've ever had and no one disagreed but the Admiral very quietly spoke himsa doc I believe everything you just said but if I don't throw the book at him what am I telling the fleet what are you telling people if you let somebody get away with an exceptional violation you're basically saying it's okay if you're highly decorated if you're popular or if you've had a lot of a lot of years in the company so to speak the truth of the matter is you have no choice you have to be just when you use punishment you have to be the same across the board and that's the point so when we look at these things if I go around in and I tell you that I've seen in your company a lot of routine violations what does that tell you says well we probably have a problem higher in the system after all is the problem of the teenage daughter that gets in at 10:30 or 11:00 or midnight or is a problem with a parent who lets them get away with it it's with the parent now you hold the child accountable but the reason they're getting in so late and having all the problems is because of the parent it's supervision and organizational failure that's leading to these routine violations so when we see a routine violation you have to go around look at enforcement are we enforcing the rules are we holding people accountable if it's exceptional violation now you may have no choice but to terminate the individual so the point I'm trying to make when we deal with unsafe acts is each of these very discrete boxes have very discreet fixes associated with them it's absolutely important you understand these and so I wanted to spend some time we spent a little more time talking about the unsafe acts then we will about the other tiers certainly there's much more to this there's books written on it we've written books on it but I just wanted to give you that background for now and so with that I'm gonna leave you with this party shot with the unsafe acts we talked about decision heirs or what we'll call think we talked about skill-based errors or what we're gonna call doing errors we talked about perceptual errors perceiving errors and how each of those happen within normal human behavior very predictable and they're honest mistakes we all make and the fixes are very unique then we talked about the violation as the willful willful was the key word intentional basically violations or the willful disregard for the rules and regulations and they continuing airworthines management exposition in two real generic flavors routine which is it's condoned by management organizations and supervisors they let them get away with it everybody does it and it becomes part of their behaviors behavior they rtca document (“document order”) it all the time and then we talked about exceptional violations these are the driving 120 if it's right these are not exceptional by the very fact that there are so egregious but it's that nobody else does them it's certainly not condoned and it's really not part of their behavior they don't rtca document (“document order”) it all the time it's just what were they thinking so with that I will leave you and we'll come back next time and we'll talk about the preconditions for unsafe acts . 2 - Preconditions for Unsafe Acts Well let's pick up where we left off last time what I want to talk about today is the preconditions for unsafe acts last time we talked briefly about Jim reasons Swiss cheese model of human aerospace information report and then we kind of went through the unsafe acts of operations those errors and violations and what we're going to rtca document (“document order”) today is continue our discussion by looking at the preconditions for those unsafe acts in other words what was it about the individual that day that was different than any other day and the way we're gonna rtca document (“document order”) that is we're gonna look at really we're gonna start first by looking at what I'll call the condition of the operator in other words the condition the person at the pointing in the spirit the person is actually doing the work so let's take a look at three things we look at adverse mental states adverse physiological states and physical mental limitations and let's take a peek at each of those for a second when I talk about adverse mental states I'm not talking about whether or not the person was crazy or not that may or may not be an issue what I'm really interested in are really two issues the attitude to mental well-being and the mental framework of the individual and then their cognitive state and I know that that's kind of a basic I'm trying to get an understanding of what they're thinking and how they're thinking so when we look at attitudes we look at things like anger happiness a variety of frustration those sorts of things all impact performance I mean after all if I'm angry if you remember my story from the unsafe acts when I was angry that I had to take my daughter to her choir recital I wasn't it affected the way I was thinking so and it also affected it light-emitting diode to the skill-based here because I wasn't no longer was I paying attention because when I'm angry it's hard to you know really focus on what you're doing or if you're frustrated we've all been frustrated in a task or if I really want to get you if I want to fail somebody on the exam I can fail anybody on an exam it's very simple and I don't have to write tricky questions or anything basically here's what I can rtca document (“document order”) to really ruin your basically what I could rtca document (“document order”) is set up the exam so the hardest questions are first and the easier ones are towards the end because if I can get you stressed out if I can get you frustrated if I can get you to a point where you're almost like oh I'm just I've spent all this time in oh I can't believe it I can't answer the first five questions it doesn't matter how easy the last ones are you'll never get them that's why a lot of test takers will tell you what you need to rtca document (“document order”) is you go around through the exam quickly first just look at it and start answering all the ones you can answer real easily now hopefully there's more than one or two but but the truth is that when you look at it that way what happens is when you get stressed out you start forgetting things you start making mistakes one of the classics is when I went through flight training in the Navy I wanted to be a pilot my whole life you have to understand this was my biggest thing and I went through ground school where you learn all about the plane and the engine and all that and I aced everything I knew it all and I worked really really hard to understand and know everything and one of the first things they rtca document (“document order”) when your instructor takes you out to the aircraft in the Navy is they open up the cowling of the the engine cowling and they start pointing at parts of the engine now I've looked at this countless times I mean they'll show you things that are just some of what your obvious but some of the things are a little more tricky and he starts showing me the tricky things first I don't think he intended to make my life miserable but I just forgot and the more I forgot and the more I got frustrated embarrassed I couldn't even remember the easy stuff I mean my goodness he could have showed me the oil pan I would have had no clue so because my stress meter was right here and and I wasn't thinking I kept thinking ah man I'm screwing up I've worked on this so hard and I'm messing up and that stress made it harder and harder for me to memory emember remember which consequently light-emitting diode to decision aerospace information report skill boosters in a variety of other problems so my point being is that things like stress things like anger all these things frustration happiness even you can be so happy and so excited that you can't remember anything and we've all been there too you know your your oh man this is the best this is what I've been waiting on the whole time and I forgot my lines I don't know if you've ever acted or been in a play I've done that many times and it's it's very interesting that you just forget even practicing these lines forever and you forget well there's also cognitive States and it's not I mean cognition and this whole idea it means is somewhat complex to some some people but all we're really talking about here are things like attention distraction overconfidence complacency these sorts of things will impact performance I mean let's face it if I'm overconfident I'm more likely to rtca document (“document order”) what I'm more likely to violate the rules you don't find 16 year old kids who just just learn how to drive their car I'm driving 120 miles an hour but give them six months of experience under their belt they get a little complacent overconfident and the next thing you know they're taking risks that their skill set can't get them out of so we look at these things we look at attention filters how those might lead to skill based airs we've talked about that we look at things like tasks fixation you're so focused on doing one thing you miss everything else around you so these are very important concepts and these are mental states now the key about those is they're transient but you can turn them on and off you can be angry and I can turn that on or off I can be in the middle of a loud discussion with my wife you know I mean we're going at it about something and it's probably stupid but we're talking and we're getting angrier and angrier and then my cell phone rings I pick up the cell phone and it's my best friend it's stuck it's like dude what's up hey watch it you hey listen Cindy and I are talking can I call you back in about 15 minutes and the next thing you know I hang up this are you right back at it I can turn it on and turn it off I get and we all rtca document (“document order”) this we rtca document (“document order”) this all the time you don't go around around life always unhappy you don't go around around life always angry now it may be that people think you're always angry because that's what they see and a lot of people think I'm just mr. happy-go-lucky but I have bad days too and and the truth is you can turn it on and you can turn it off these are transient events so let's compare that to what we're gonna call adverse physiological states now we're not talking about you mentally we're not talking about your coking and the way you think we're talking about issues about you physiologically now we can talk about this in aviation we can talk about things like hypoxia the lack of oxygen we can talk about physical fatigue where we're in adverse mental states we might talk about mental fatigue and how being tired can affect performance in physiological states we can talk about physical fatigue let's face it if you're lifting 50-pound bags of dog food and you're doing this in the first three four or five no big deal have to just throw a lot you know maybe the next five aren't so tough either but eventually those 50-pound bags of dog food get heavier and heavier in your arms get sore and sore and eventually you get physically fatigued so that's quite different than mental fatigue that we would see in adverse mental states we're going to talk a lot about that in this course and when we talk about the fatigue lecture and the issue of mental fatigue but from a physiological point of view you have a you have a physical fatigue you have to deal with as well I mean if seriously standing here talking to you is no big deal but if I had to stand here for the next 48 hours I can assure you my legs are getting tired and I'm gonna be physically exhausted and that's just the way it works so we have physical fatigue we also have things like illness simply being ill can affect the way you perform rtca document (“document order”) you believe that I mean let's face it how many of us have not went to work sect I certainly have come to work sick I don't feel well today I kind of a rough night with my sinuses and stuff but I'm here so we all go around to work sick and in essence it's interesting because that's what we rtca document (“document order”) we feel in the u.s. you know it's one of those things where we feel compelled to go around to work even though we may have sick days you know it's like well I stay home I won't get I mean I don't get any rest there so I'm us we'll come in and share my illness with everybody right I mean people come to work sick but let's play a game it's called you bet your life we all have to play the game and the way the games play is very simple I'm gonna ask you three very easy questions if you get them all right I'm gonna give you $100 if you get any of them wrong I'm gonna kill you real yeah it's a reality game it's a great reality game probably well of course not we're not going to rtca document (“document order”) it for real but let's pretend we would so let me let me rtca document (“document order”) this remember it's called you bet your life if you get all the questions right you get $100 if you get any of them long we're gonna kill you for real but to make it a more user-friendly game I'm going to give you the questions in advance so you can study and you can practice first question where were you born pretty easy right second question what was your mother's maiden name third and final question what high school did you graduate from I mean these are not difficult questions the trick is you have to answer them right the first time and quickly it's a simple game I'm gonna ask you three easy questions you get them all right you get $100 you continuing airworthines management exposition along or you're too slow we're gonna kill you for real were you born mothers made a name high school you graduated from really simple questions so now you can play any time you want in the next five days so you just tell me when you're ready to play how many of you would choose to play over any other time how many would choose to play with the flu how many would choose to play my game over any other time hung over from too much drinking the night before of alcohol had a really wild party how many would choose to play my game self-medicating on nyquil a really heavy cold medicine probably not well let's go around over to the mental states how many would choose to play my game with only three hours of sleep well then how many would choose to play my game at 3:00 in the morning over any other time yeah you're tired would choose to play my game after just witnessing the birth of your first child a blessing of that I mean this is exciting this is good how many would choose to play my game after just getting an argument with your wife curious I've investigated fatal accidents in all those situations go around figure you know sometimes our bodies and our heads are in the game we're not at a hundred percent I paid for a hundred percent I expect you to come to the job at a hundred percent and think about this let's plus e would take this one step further would it bother you to know that the next time you fly on a commercial airliner you're flying that commercial jet from Greenville Spartanburg South Carolina where we live here too oh I don't know we're gonna go around to Atlanta enroute to some other place would it bother you to know that the people that were in the front of that aircraft were ready to take off in that aircraft but we're unwilling to play my game does that bother you for those of you that say no now that does I mean 90 percent that's okay I'm good with that we'll wait a minute I can tell you as someone who's flown in the Navy I never once had a crew chief come up to me and say you know doc you're gonna lose an engine yeah I don't know which one you got to them so that's good but you're gonna lose one of those two inches no one's ever told me that you never know when the emergencies coming and if you're not at a hundred percent because if you lose an engine it's not the end of the world if you rtca document (“document order”) everything right you shut down the bad engine and you rtca document (“document order”) everything right on all the steps correctly you can land on one engine it's not the end of the world now is it optimal no but you should be able to survive that but you never know when it's coming and you have to get those easy questions right the first time quickly and be on top you're getting when you want them on top of their game if they have an emergency on takeoff don't you want those pilots to be at a hundred percent is 90 percent still okay or worse yet let's say you have to go around in and god forbid you have to have brain you have to have a tumor removed in your brain or you have an open heart surgery would it bother you to know that this heart surgeon was willing to cut on your heart but was unwilling to play my game does that bother you it should would it bother you to know that that that neurosurgeon that was going to cut open your coconut and take that tumor out of your brain was willing to rtca document (“document order”) that but he was unwilling to play my game so he's willing to bet your life so I I expect the surgeon to pilot those people in those critical tasks to be at 100% and I used to give this lecture and say well you know if you're me you're a college professor when I was with the federal aviation administration I mean the worst thing that could possibly happen on the job as I get a paper cut I mean I I was working at a computer there was nobody I could hurt until I one day gave this lecture and I think it was at an army conference or something but one of the one of the attendees continuing airworthines management exposition up at the at the break and said well doc let me ask you a question how did you get to work I drove oh really so you were willing to drive when you weren't at a hundred percent you never know doc when you're gonna have that flat tire you never know doc when when that cars could swerve out in front you never know doc when things are gonna go around bad and you have to react quickly and right the first time he had a point if you're not at the top of your game why are you even driving to work you know I'm not advocating that everybody that hardware accomplishment summary a sniffle shouldn't go around to work but well you have to ask yourself is this the risk I'm willing to take most of us don't even consider the risk and especially if you're in a high you know if you're a surgeon I mean let's face it you really shouldn't be cutting on somebody if you're not feeling well and you're not at a hundred percent because you're not no matter how hard you try you can't get there there's no data showing that oh I can just overcome it for one month for an hour I can I can suck it up and rtca document (“document order”) it no you can't you're at your you have degraded performance so we'll see that throughout this course so we had adverse mental states in adverse physiological states and those were those transient states that yeah you know the bottom line is if you're angry you can get over that if you're sick you either get better you DYI both of them are in games sort of thing so you're going to get better their short-term and you have some level of control over them on the other hand when we look at physical mental limitations we're not talking it's not quite that simple I mean here what we're talking about other things like you know the more common things this we all understand as I as I often point out we all understand why not everyone can play in the NFL National Football League not everybody is going to be an NBA National Basketball Association basketball player or a world-class soccer player not everybody is going to be a concert pianist not everybody's going to be able to win American Idol to be a singer right and we all understand yeah I have no singing talent I'm not a good-looking guy I'm not gonna be an actor I'm not Brad Pitt I don't know if you noticed that but I'm not so I probably don't have the aptitude or the talent or the appearance to be a famous movie standard terminal arrival routes so if that's if we can all accept that why is it that everybody thinks they can be a pilot they can be a surgeon they can be you know there's so many occupations that I've said on two types of selection boards where we're selecting people for an occupation one was a pilot selection board for military pilots fighter pilots the other one was for medical school and in both of those cases I've had people on the other side of the table who were applied tell me it was their god-given right to fly fighter jets in the US Navy Marine Corps really well I'm looking at your grades from the Training Command when you're flying a t-34 prop aircraft and you fail 9 tests usually if you fail - you're out how you ended up here I don't know I'm surprised you found the room the truth is you don't have the aptitude to fly jets or I'll have a medical a potential medical student come in and we rtca document (“document order”) interviews and I'm looking at this record his grades are you know he's a C student which isn't bad I mean no offense I mean that's great you can still get through and you can have a very good occupation his MCAT his medical college admissions test scores are low they're like the twenty or thirty eighth percentile and this person wants to be a physician now I would ask you is this the guy you want cutting on your heart no because there's an aptitude for being a physician there are certain scores on things like chemistry physics biochemistry that we expect out of those people so you have their aptitudes for it just because you don't have the aptitude to be a nurse doesn't mean you're a bad person it just simply means you don't have those skills or that after the potential to be a nurse not everybody can be any more than everyone can be an automatic mechanic I have no aptitude for McCann being a mechanic ask my wife I'm the guy that when he repairs something I always have parts left over I'll have a couple screws some washers some not I have things left over I have coffee cans full of stuff left over because my attitude is hey if it ain't go around back on it must not have been important well guess what it was and a lot of times it thinks I fix in the brake and worse than what I fixed them Ali have to rtca document (“document order”) is ask my wife she'll tell you that I have no mechanical aptitude I have people change my oil I know a lot if you change your own oil it's not rocket science but you know what I'd probably screw it up I don't have the aptitude to be a mechanic so it would submit to you that when we look at these things we look at not only physical aptitude whether its appearance or your strength you know things like that or height or I mean we all understand why the person that's three feet high probably isn't going to play in the NBA we all understand why I'm not gonna be Brad Pitt an actor I mean we all understand this why is it though that we don't seem to understand that not everybody can rtca document (“document order”) what they want to rtca document (“document order”) sometimes we just simply don't have the aptitude for it and we also get things like currency proficiency show up here because when I haven't had when I haven't had the training I'm limited mentally I don't have you know my four-year-old daughter was limited she had a mental limitation for dressing herself not because she's a dummy or that she doesn't have the potential she just simply at the moment didn't really know how it was gonna take a long time to develop those skills so during that time she was limited my my 18 year old daughter actually when she was first learn how to drive she was limited I mean I wouldn't feel comfortable at all with her driving a school bus which is 16 that's silly she's limited in what she can rtca document (“document order”) so when we look at this so currency proficiency you're limited for a period time but you can overcome that it just takes a longer time you can overcome I can overcome having bad eyes I mean when I got older my eyesight went away you know I have typical presbyopia as you get older you you have a harder time you get federal aviation regulation side you can't you know you can't see things up close so you get these cheaters you know and I'm starting to lose my hearing so I'm limited I can't hear as well as I once did alright so these are things that I can overcome with a hearing airport information desk or glasses but again these are permanent or longer-term disabilities or or limitations don't really want to use the term disability because I mean obviously being six foot two isn't a disability but it sure is a pain when I'm on a plane and my knees are in the back of the seat in front of me okay so I just want to make sure you understand the difference we have we have adverse mental states and adverse physiological states that are transient events that affect performance both mentally and physically and then we have this physical mental limitations that are more long-term maybe involve aptitudes physical mental aptitudes maybe involve some limitations some liabilities or disabilities that you've accrued over the years whether they be eyesight or hearing or something like that that you can overcome with some devices occasionally and with some training all right so we've talked about the condition of the operator that person at the pointing of the spear let's now talk about the next step which would be let's go around take a look at personal and interpersonal factors things that we rtca document (“document order”) to ourselves okay and I mean this is not a good title for this category but basically what I want to capture two things one is basically the communication coordination and planning that's our first one we want to look at there most of us don't work alone most of us interact with other people and as a result we we have to communicate alright this is I mean this is marriage 101 right you have to learn to communicate and coordinate you know and we rtca document (“document order”) this all the time you rtca document (“document order”) it without even thinking we're all the time I mean if we go around out to dinner or were you know we're working with colleagues we communicate in class I communicate with you to give you information so that you can learn and we and the first day of class we hand out a syllabus so I can communicate my expectations and and basically have a contract with you on what you can expect out of the class kind of where we're gonna go around when the exams are gonna be I have to communicate that if I don't rtca document (“document order”) it well you get what happens if I don't tell you when the exams are coming and I just saw this think I'm gonna go around okay time for the exam you get angry for I mean at least to all sorts of mental states stress anger frustration I mean it's just as a whole cascade and then you make a lot of errors decision errors because if I don't communicate at least the confusion anger all this stuff which leads to bad decisions so obviously you want to know what's coming we also have to coordinate because I want to make sure I rtca document (“document order”) this all the time because I know that I have certain trips that I know I'm going to have to take so I will look at the syllabus for the semester and I will coordinate the exam so if I'm out of town if I'm out of town for an exam that doesn't matter I have teaching assistants that can come in and give the exam and I trust you guys your graduates it's no big deal but the truth of the matter is that I have to coordinate that I have to coordinate with other of my colleagues that I may have projects I'm working with I have to coordinate with my wife at home when I'm out of town because we have things we're doing as well so coordination is a key component so is planning you have to plan things if you're the type of person who just simply takes life as it comes you're not going to be very successful most of the you have to be able to plan things to some level now you don't have to be you don't have to over plan because that can be just as bad but the truth of the matter is that we want to plan things out so communication coordination and planning are critical elements in ensuring that decisions are done are made with the best information and the best knowledge I mean we want to make sure we have a successful outcome so communication coordination planning are very important particularly when we're dealing with teams of individuals and most of you are going to go around out into the workplace and work with teams so if you have a little bit of background about how people communicate how they how they coordinate their activities and plan things you can be quite successful so then we have the other category which we're gonna call fitness for duty I expect people to come to the job ready to perform I expect you to come to class ready to learn and I know that sounds a little bizarre when when the first day in graduate school we come in and we say treat graduate school like a job treat it like your job like your life depends on it like your livelihood because it does if you treat graduate school like a job and not like you did when you were an undergrad you were having a lot of fun and woohoo I mean you can still have fun and work the truth is the what I want you to think about is think about this is like a job I'm gonna be working my job from 8 o'clock til I don't know 8 maybe it's 8 to 8 maybe it's 12 hours and I've got some time in there for eating and maybe socializing a little bit or going out and exercising but it's a job and when you treat it as a job that means I have to come to work ready to perform you wouldn't show up to work hungover I bet you most of you have never done that or would even consider it most of you wouldn't think about coming into work with only two hours to sleep the night before that would be bad you wouldn't think about coming into work self-medicating you know oh I don't feel well so I bought some medicine from a friend you would never consider doing that and then going to work in a factory or or doing you know being whatever you're going to rtca document (“document order”) in engineering the truth is when we talk fitness for duty it's basically I expect the employee to come to the job ready to perform to be it a hundred percent or as close to it as they can get yeah but here's the kicker let me ask you a question this is a tough one if somebody shows up to work hungover they're not legally drunk but they're visibly hungover they smell of alcohol you know you've we've we've know people that have been there right if they physically are unable to perform but they show up for work anyways what rtca document (“document order”) you think would happen to them what rtca document (“document order”) you think would happen to someone that shows up at the Boeing factory hungover what is going to happen or maybe they show up truly you know maybe their blood alcohol is just below the legal limit so they're legal to drive but they're clearly drunk what rtca document (“document order”) you think is gonna happen if you're thinking well we're gonna fire them you're probably not right would you consider somebody that shows up for work let's say I'm I'm at home for breakfast I decided this morning I was gonna have a oh I don't know a Bloody Mary so that's tomato juice and I think vodka and I'm gonna have a Bloody Mary before work as man I had a rough night last night at uh I need a Bloody Mary is that a violation like we talked about in the last segment we talked about violations the willful disregard for the rules and regulations or is that a fitness for duty issue I mean they're both bad don't get me wrong they're both outside the realm of what we accept but they're quite different if I'm drinking at home if I'm having a Bloody Mary before coming to work and I show up with alcohol on my breath and they they find out that I had a Bloody Mary I had a drink for breakfast I'm probably not going to be fired I'm probably gonna be put in some sort of alcohol rehabilitation program there will be some sort of intervention program that will work with me because I have a problem but let's flip that let's say I come because I typically my breakfast here on campus and I'll eat in my office for breakfast so let's say instead of having that Bloody Mary at home I now get into my cabin I reach behind I get myself some I think it's tomato juice is Worcestershire whatever they put in there and some lot of vodka and I start having a Bloody Mary for breakfast here what rtca document (“document order”) you think is gonna happen quite different right because we don't allow our in our professors to drink alcohol while they're working yeah I mean most employers don't so the point is I would probably be terminated right because happening on the job is different than off the job so when we talk about fitness for duty we're talking about things that you rtca document (“document order”) off the job on your own time that affect your performance on the job when I talk about violations those same things you did off the job which may have been okay because it was on your own time you rtca document (“document order”) them in here you're gonna get in trouble so it's important to understand the distinction because the fixes are very different the fix for drinking on the job is probably termination the fix for drinking before you come to work is probably some sort of intervention all right so with that we walk over to the environmental factors so here we're talking about really two things the physical environment and the technological environment and my physical environment what rtca document (“document order”) I mean we're gonna spend a lot of time in this class talking about things like lighting noise vibration all temperature all these things affect your performance absolutely if the lights are down low and it's dim in the room you're more prone to perceptual errors if it's a very loud noisy environment you're more prone to perceptual errors if I make it really noisy at all it's harder to think so you're more prone to decision errors so it certainly impacts your performance likewise I can turn the light stuff I always have my classes from 8:00 to 9:00 I like early morning classes because it gets everybody the first in the morning they're all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed ready to go around and I don't have to deal with that postprandial dip after lunch some people like teaching later in the day but you know what now I'm competing with this natural tendency to be tired and I can put anybody to sleep all I have to rtca document (“document order”) is turn the lights down low put the temperature up just a little bit so it's a little warmer in the room start talking nice and soft and the next thing you know you're especially if I'm doing some sort of math on the board or whatever the the point I'm trying to make is that light temperature quiet noise all impact performance a better example temperature I give this one all the time I talked about how if you're driving in San Diego County San Diego California beautiful place to live on the west coast you ever been there you'll know exactly what I'm talking about it's one of the most attractive places to live in the country because the temperature is pretty steady it's always in the 70s it's beautiful now I don't want to rain and I mean it's just a it's a wonderful environment and let's say you're out on a back road and you're driving your car and also you hear the thump thump thump thump thump thump thump you've got a flat tire now this sucks I understand that nobody likes a flat tire and you're on a cellphone range so you can't call to have somebody rtca document (“document order”) it for you you're gonna have to change that tire alright this right I mean you can rtca document (“document order”) this you've you've seen it you've you when you were learning how to drive they showed you how to rtca document (“document order”) it right so you go around into the trunk you get the jack out you find the spot to jack up your guard and then the next thing you know you got the tires off the ground well actually be foot tiger so if your and you start to loosen lug nuts right then you take the lug nuts off when you get it off the ground you pull the the the tire that's that's got the flat you pull it off of the car you go around into the back of the trunk you find this little clown pie or this thing that you know imitates a tire and you put it on there and you tighten up the lug nuts and you rtca document (“document order”) it just right in the patterns they showed you how to rtca document (“document order”) when you're in driver's education and you double check all those lug nuts because the last thing you want is that little teeny tiny tire to fall off when you're driving to get the other bigger tire repaired right so you go around ahead and you change it to higher no big deal you're not happy but it's safe well let's change it a little bit let's now make it instead of sunny San Diego let's say you're in Seattle Washington in October it's about 35 degrees out just above freezing and it's drizzling and you have that same flat tire are you going to take the same amount of time to ensure it's on there safely are you gonna double check those lug nuts when it's drizzling and cold probably not so you're more likely to make a mistake a decision error or let's change it and say now we're in Phoenix in August where it's about a hundred and five degrees ambient temperature it's probably about 140 degrees coming up off that pavement are you gonna take just as much time to repair that tire I would suggest you probably won't you don't want to be out in that heat a more than the next guy you just want to get it done what I'm trying to point out here is that temperature also affects performance we're gonna see that we're gonna rtca document (“document order”) a whole module on that later in this course so certainly the physical environment impacts performance and we'll look very closely how it does that later the last category I want to talk about before we close out this module is the technological environment here what we're talking about the typical thing that everybody's used to talking about is the human machine interface we can talk about things like use the building the way things are designed and and some things are designed very user friendly some things are I mean you could take your typical remote control yeah I mean I look at this and and it looks pretty self-explanatory until you start trying to figure out which one it controls because to rtca document (“document order”) this video I had two of them I don't know which one goes there and which one goes there and there's no they're different they got things that different buttons federal aviation regulation nearby I don't know all this stuff it's not particularly user friendly now it's not unused friendly but it's just not the system is not set up to be necessarily user friendly we could talk about cell phones a lot of you who might have blackberries some of you have a iPhones I have an iPhone I used to have a blackberry the guy that invented the BlackBerry was a they're very rich but when he designed it he didn't make it user friendly because if you you know I have fat fingers right okay so I would get it invariably I'm on the road a lot and I would get a phone call and I didn't it didn't have a chance to answer it so I'm now driving home it's late at night it's dark and I noticed that I have three phone messages not a big deal I can handle that so I pull out the cell phone and I start listening to my voicemail and I know it's a client it's somebody that I'm going to be doing some work with so I want to save that voicemail what rtca document (“document order”) I have to rtca document (“document order”) what button rtca document (“document order”) I have to push well to say that you push the nine key if I want to delete it I push the seven key and they are literally a fraction of an inch apart I'm driving down the road at night I'm tired and I want to save push 9 but I pushed not at 7 and 6 they're so close together they're less than a quarter of an inch apart I've just lost the voicemail how stupid is that to have a system designed like that the iPhone was made for idiots like me the iPhone was made for me because in reality I have two very big buttons if I want to save or delete and if I delete the voicemail it still puts it in a folder that I can get back oh I didn't mean to delete I can go around get it back real quick I have to physically go around basically rub the top of my head system-theoretic accident model and processes a foot and click my fingers at the same time to get rid of my voicemails and it's not quite that complex but I have to go around through multiple steps to get rid of voicemails because of that very reason people delete them by accident they built a user friendly system so we can talk I mean we can go around on and on and on there's books written about this we have a course two classes I would encourage you to take one is ie 801 and the other ones I 802 ones like it's basically a usability graduate usability course there's there's a beginner's and an expert kind of thing and that's taught by dr. Greenstein I think you'd enjoyed a lot most of our graduate students will take it and and it's a whole course on this idea of usability and human-computer interaction that kind of stuff so I mean I highly recommend it I think you'd find it very useful so we spend a whole class on that multiple classes you can get a usability course over in the psych department that a lot of our art students take as well but it's much more than that let me give you a story a true story when we built our second house in Oklahoma I tell people you know when we built it my wife is a nature person she likes to look at the birds and the bees and the and and the squirrels and everything out there so if you think about your house your home where you work where you have one here or when your parents house most of them have a big front door usually it's wooden with very little glass and at least our our front doors we have some glass or on the side but well my wife really wanted to rtca document (“document order”) is be able to open up that big wood door and have another glass door which we refer to as a storm door that you can leave closed so you don't have to worry about bugs and stuff getting in but you can still see the world so you open up the big wood door and here's this glass storm door well when we built the house we didn't have one is still installed initially so my wife and I went down to Lowe's a hardware store and home improvement store and we went out and we picked out a storm door a glass storm door my uh I think was Larsen Larsen storm doors beautiful door absolutely gorgeous very ornate beautiful glass tempered glass with etching in in it and we picked this door out together and we brought it home and it's a kid it takes about three hours to put it together yeah and so my wife suggested that you know I'm reasonably smart I could probably rtca document (“document order”) it so I did I I'd rather than get somebody to rtca document (“document order”) it I decide I was going to rtca document (“document order”) it and she knows me pretty well I got a PhD I don't need no stinking instructions right so I got the hawk watching she's watching me watching out that window to make sure I'm following the instructions and for the first time of my adult life I'm actually going step by step I mean I've got these instructions out and I'm going step by step I mean and that the instructions are bow you think it's a three-hour process you know how they have the little check boxes as you get things done you check them off I'm checking them off I'm going I'm just bang I'm doing it I'm an hour and a half into this the Hawks watching I'm everything's right I'm an hour and a half into this in the next step about step one hundred says measure up three and a half inches from the base of the Z bar this Z bar is a one inch wide bar that runs the length of the door jamb okay see you got you know where the hinges are that's your door jamb and that bar gets screwed into the door jamb that wood door jamb and that's what you hang this big storm guards that's pretty important it supports the big storm door and and ties it in to your door jamb but more importantly its ornate it's it's it's this one was Kelly Yuri it was dark green and it had edgings and it was beautiful I mean it's meant to be pretty but also useful so so this measure up three and a half inches from the bases Ziebart cut it off with your hacksaw not a problem I can rtca document (“document order”) that so I measure up three and half inches 3nf inches measure twice right you know measure twice we've got it okay I cut through I cut through the Z bar all the way through blink off goes the end now that's not a big deal I'm thinking I'm right on the mark step 101 okay step 101 before cutting the Z bar ensure you have this kind of door well guess what I didn't have the kind of door that I'm supposed to have so guess what I have a three and a half inch gap at the base of the Z bar because I didn't need to cut it off yeah it turns out I didn't have the kind of door that required me to cut it off as a result now I've got wood exposed at the bottom I was showing everybody that ever visited how her PhD husband screwed up simple instructions what it wasn't my fault now it got worse I will tell you this head my parents continuing airworthines management exposition over and my wife explained to my family what I'd done and said you know Scott would you and your dad like to put a storm door on the kitchen that exits out on the patio sure we can rtca document (“document order”) that you know you get those father-son things right so we went out and we bought another large sandstorm door it was about the same size as the the original one on the front it's the same style but it had the same exact manual we get out there we're having that beautiful day and we're out there we're at step that same set we're having a great day we hit that same step my dad says measure up three and a half inches from the base of the Z board cut it off with your hacksaw now problem dad I can rtca document (“document order”) that I get half with her I'm like oh because guess what the very next step says before cutting the C bar ensure you have this kind of door and I don't have that kind of door on the back either my wife would take great pride in showing everybody how I messed up the front door and then my dad and I messed up the back door you know the apple doesn't fall too federal aviation regulation from the tree it got one worse my in-laws continuing airworthines management exposition over about six months later and you'll find out when you have in-laws that one of the things that you rtca document (“document order”) as a son-in-law is you get together with your dad and your father-in-law and you have projects you rtca document (“document order”) you'll keep him occupied that's what we rtca document (“document order”) so my wife said well rtca document (“document order”) you think you and Jeff could put a storm door on the master bedroom that exits out in the back yard sure we can rtca document (“document order”) that we went down to Lowe's again while another large storm door identical to the one out of the kitchen that I had done with my dad we come back and I will admit we had a little liquid gold on board we were having a few beers we were not drunk but we were having a good time we were sharing stories and it was fun I was with my father-in-law Jeff and we get along real well and we're out there talking and we get to that same exact step this hardware accomplishment summary measure of three and a half inches from this base of the Z bar and cut it off with your hacksaw I go around over there I measure up three and a half inches this time there's a bright yellow sticker it says ensure your measurement with that three knife inches Jeff yeah 3.5 inches through the sticker I cut through this sticker my wife never removed the sticker yeah go around figure I mean come on my wife took great pride in showing everybody how I messed up the front door alone I messed up the back door out of the kitchen with my parents with my dad and I mixed up the master bedroom because now we got another chunk out with a sticker on it saying ensure your measurement with my father-in-law now I tried to explain to I said honey this is technological environment these people mess up you should never write instructions with the next step saying don't rtca document (“document order”) what the first step said this is technological viruses no it's not it's physical mental limitations you're an idiot she might have been right but the point here is you're gonna find that there are instructions there a checklist written there just written poorly and people follow them they adhere to them they go around step by step like I did and then they mess it up whose fault is it rtca document (“document order”) you think Larson knew that they had a problem with their with their checklist with their procedure yes they did why else would they put the sticker there you can't fit why didn't they just replace the manuals well probably cost more they probably had multiple manuals printed up and the and that the truth is that you know at the end of the day it might have been cheaper to fix it with a sticker you're gonna see when you get out in the real world that people rather than replace the checklist or the procedure although this put on the internet will send an email we'll put the equivalent of a sticker out there and hope that everybody gets it right well more importantly I would go around one step further I'd say ask yourself this who rtca document (“document order”) we go around out there and test these products on to make sure that no one will have a problem if somebody is is building an a fighter aircraft and they go around out on a higher test pilots our test pilots good pilots are bad pilots if you look at it on a scale from here's the best pilots here and here are the worst pilots there where would you put the test pilot are they closer to the good pilot are they closer to the bad pilot on that continuum I would submit to you the test pilots are closer to the good pilots they might even be excellent pilots so if that's true then let me ask you this can a test pilot can an excellent pilot can a good pilot pretend to be a bad pilot can they behave like a bad pilot no no they don't know can a bad nut get a bad pilot pretend to be a good pilot know who is your more likely person to screw things up is it the best pilot or the worst pilot it's the worst model right so why aren't we going out and finding test pilots that look like the people that are gonna have the problems why rtca document (“document order”) we get test pilots that look like people that will never really have a problem think about it this way car design if you're gonna design a minivan who you gonna go around I could get to test-drive and help you design it are you gonna just design it at you're gonna have some some computer graphics geek in some room and in Michigan up there at Ford sitting there going and design in it well maybe initially but when you test it to see how you want things laid out and how it feels and how it looks who rtca document (“document order”) you get to test drive that are you gonna go around get 17 year old males to rtca document (“document order”) that no are you gonna get people like me to rtca document (“document order”) it no I'm not gonna drive a minivan I have no interest who rtca document (“document order”) you get you go around get soccer moms you go around get moms cuz moms Drive minivans and they I mean if you look at the way people design minivans they design it for mothers so they have certain cupholders in certain spots they have certain things that as a mom you would really like integrated child seats stuff like that because that's what moms want if you're gonna if you're gonna build a a Corvette who rtca document (“document order”) you design that for you designed it for the 16 year old boy know they can't afford a Corvette you go around find fat bald men like me and then I designed it for them make sure they fit in it make sure it's designed for because they're the guys that can afford them and they're the guys that have to have them so they can look younger all of a sudden I mean the point here is that you designed for the people that are going to use it and you make sure that your design matches their aptitude so it's not surprising that when you build when you give me a manual on how to put a storm door together if you didn't design it for the person that isn't particularly mechanically inclined may have a physical mental limitation as my wife pointed out you're going to have a problem and they did you're gonna see if you go around to work for international companies you're going to see a lot of instructions and checklists are translated into other languages and when we translate into into other languages we lose meaning we lose order and a whole host of things we're going to talk about that a week when we talk about information processing about how the order of things matters the order of the way things come in a checklist matters with that we've talked about all the preconditions for unsafe acts we spoke about the condition of the operator we talked about adverse mental states physiological states and physical mental limitations then we transition talking about communication coordination and planning fitness for duty we've followed up and we wrapped up with physical environment and technological environment to kind of give you a sense and we're going to cover all those things in greater detail within this class within ie 800 with that we'll come back the next module we're going to we're going to combine the Supervisory and organizational tier and I think you'll find those useful as well thank you. 3 – Unsafe Supervision and Organizational Influence Welcome back we're going to continue our discussion of the human factors analysis and classification system today talking about the unsafe supervision and organizational influences so as we progress through we've we've talked about the unsafe acts of operators those people at the pointing of this fear we talked about those errors and violations that people commit and how we could design in their in and intervene and mitigate the consequences of some of those actions and then we talked about the preconditions for unsafe acts those things that set us up for failure if you will those things that make us you know what was different that day than any other day when you were operating on on in your situation so what I want to talk about now though is something that a lot of us overlook which would be those factors at the very highest level so we're talking about the Supervisory and organizational tiers supervisory tier being middle management as a middle manager myself and let me just get a started here as a middle management myself both in the military and in the civilian sector when I was in the military I was a Navy captain before that a commander lieutenant commander and so on that's really middle management so we're not talking about Admirals and Generals we're talking about the people that are really the middle management of an organization so what we're talking about is that first second third level supervisor and as as a manager both in the Federal Aviation Administration and then in the military my job was to give people the opportunity to succeed that means I had to provide them the tools they needed to rtca document (“document order”) the job to rtca document (“document order”) it right and and actually when we look at unsafe supervision or super super visor factors we really look at four things we look at inadequate supervision planning appropriate activities failed to correct known problems and supervisor violations and let me walk through these I mean this is really something that it's better left to industrial organizational psychology but we're just going to give you a quick and dirty overview in this particular human factors course just to give you a sense for what sorts of things you might want to look at well in act with supervision as I mentioned to you earlier my job as a supervisor to is to provide my employees the opportunity to succeed that means I have to provide him oversight guidance mentoring training moral fiber whatever it takes to get the job done short of doing it myself so what it probably did give you a good example when I was a manager with the Federal Aviation Administration the federal aviation administration when I first got there I was I was motivated about 30 some-odd masters and PhD level people working for me they were doing research in a voltsorvoltage general aviation commercial aviation and aerospace information report traffic control and we had a very large budget to rtca document (“document order”) that research both internally in house and then externally through grants and it was an interesting business because when I first got there you know my people worked in teams and so you had PhDs and masters level people working hand-in-hand doing a project and when I first got there I knew what everybody was doing I spent a year trying to get in basically putting myself in those teams and really getting embedded and understanding what they were doing and understanding the job and we had appraisals basically we would review people twice a year we had a mid-year and an annual and during those appraisals my employees would come in you know doctor so-and-so or mr. so-and-so would come in and they would sit down and I'd say so Joe you know because I've been embedded I've been watching what they've been doing I know what their research is I know what their projects are I know where they're at I know what's going on I'd say so Joe you know I've been watching and yeah you've been doing real well on that fatigue I saw the fatigue project just finished up and just you just collected a from your last subject I saw your last paper got published that was fantastic I read it I see that you've also got a proposal out for the next study I think that makes sense it looks like we're going to fund it there won't be a problem there and I see that you wanted to add a team member I think I've got sand and we're having this discussion during this review and I'm talking about all the things he's done and and I know what's going on and when it continuing airworthines management exposition to the annual appraisal where I had to actually write a write a review and they had you know it was a formal thing with all kinds of grades and stuff on it no problem he comes in I say you know you had a great year you had six pubs you did all this work you've got these projects going fantastic job here's your review take a take a gander edit take a look at it tell me what you think and if you agree with it sign here on the bottom and we would shake hands and that'd be it it was wonderful and I had a lot of really good people working for me so it was a really nice experience but then after about a year or two I started to get more and more involved in the federal aviation administration I started getting called away to sit on committees in Washington and was on telecoms video telecoms involved in a lot of meetings and planning and just the more I got involved with my management colleagues and higher up because basically as a manager you you keep moving up the chain in order to move up the chain you got you have to get on these national committees you have to rtca document (“document order”) all this other work what ended up happening is I spent less and less time with my employee so new employees would come in I really went in mentor might say well you know there's your desk there's your office there's your computer now go around rtca document (“document order”) what you rtca document (“document order”) right I really didn't I wasn't embedded in it and as engaged as I once was in all these projects so now when the mid-year review continuing airworthines management exposition around and Joe or Fred continuing airworthines management exposition in and that's it's Joe sit down so tell me what you've been doing why would I say it that way why would I why would I have him tell me what he's been up to before remember I could tell him what he's been doing well the simple truth is I really don't know so we would have a discussion so I'm basically getting a wrap up from my employee that I'm reviewing about what he's done the last six months so I'm not reviewing he's just telling me and when it continuing airworthines management exposition annual appraisal time I would usually send out an email with you know hey here's a electronic version of your your review can you go around in and fill in some bullets some things that you'd like to see there some nice things that so a communications receiver can you give me a list of your accomplishments why would I ask for that well because I don't know anymore and as a result I had my employees more often than not writing their own reviews in many ways and while I would tweak him of course but what happened was I became detached and when supervisors particularly those frontline supervisors become detached no longer rtca document (“document order”) you have management you basically have management by proxy so you've got the employees managing themselves and no longer are they getting the training that they're supposed to beginning no longer than getting the guidance the oversight the mentoring and as a result you'll see decay throughout your organization and that's a real problem so when I look at this and I look at enact with supervision in an organization I know that it can have dramatic impacts if I'm not providing you adequate training it can lead to failures of communication you have to I mean somebody hardware accomplishment summary to show you how to communicate well and plan and rtca document (“document order”) all these things which can lead to confusion which is an adverse mental state which can lead to bad decisions so these things are all connected the point being that when we see inadequate supervision oftentimes we see things like communication problems adverse mental states which are ultimately lead to the unsafe acts if I could somehow bring that manager back to the fold get him away from his computer and his email and the like and get him back engaged with his employees you'd be amazed how much more productive the organization becomes well it goes beyond that it goes into plan inappropriate activities you know I kind of joked earlier about how you can take sometimes we set people up for failure as supervisors sometimes we rtca document (“document order”) you know if I take two knuckleheads two guys that can barely fly their way out of a box they're not the best pilots and I put them on a mission at night low level in the weather in the most dangerous environment to put bombs on who knows what and they don't come back anybody surprised well no they were knuckleheads problem solved but somebody had to put him there have you ever been put into a situation there was a little more than you could handle and as a result things didn't go around quite so well I mean I would submit to you that that happens more often than we'd like to think a lot of times I see this in medicine I see a lot of times nurses particularly new hires or people that are very young get thrust into a situation they get thrust in the o.r or to the ER a new location and everybody assumes they know what they're doing I mean after all they were scheduled and put on that shift or put in that surgical suite and now they they feel compelled so I've taken someone that's not necessarily qualified a proficient for that particular position put them in that Oh are as a result they're feeling the pressure adverse mental state pressure to perform but they don't have the knowledge in order to rtca document (“document order”) some tasks for example maybe you know I don't know pick up pick any task in the o.r but they they really are limited mentally so we're looking at physical mental limitations they don't have the knowledge base in order to succeed consequently they make a bad decision they choose the wrong drug they push it too quickly whatever the case may be they're trying to rtca document (“document order”) the right thing but we put the wrong person on the job it happens all the time happens more often than we'd like to think we also look at things like risk without benefit rtca document (“document order”) we really have to rtca document (“document order”) that now does it really have to be done today I tell the story of how a lot of times management doesn't question have you ever been told you don't know how to say you have to learn to say no you can't just say yes all the time well I grew up in the Navy where the answer is always yes and you figure out how to rtca document (“document order”) it in the morning the fact is that I had an admiral who told me when you answer that phone you answer yes every time and will figure it out and that makes sense I mean I understand the the point of that but it goes beyond that think of it this way when I left the the federal aviation administration last day on the job you know one of the things about the federal government is Friday sir you think Fridays are great days you know you got the week in it no Friday's were usually bad days because usually sometime around Friday afternoon you get a phone call from Washington headquarters and they say oh we need to know blah blah blah by close of business today so we can have it I needed on my desk Monday morning so I can brief the administrator the administrators the is the head of the federal aviation administration or someone really important in the agency or in the administration and so we would get it in Oklahoma City we get a call around two o'clock in the afternoon be one o'clock here and in Washington and it'd be drop everything listed something as silly as maybe you know what was the know how many Cessna 172s crashed in southwest region between 1995 and 2000 I mean something trivial but it takes time to figure that out there's an analysis that hardware accomplishment summary to take place it might take two or three hours to figure that but we have the answer we can get the answer and that's it that's a reasonable question to ask if you're dealing with general aviation flight safety it's so we would get to call on the call woods base to say well we need this by the close of business today or first thing Monday morning for the administrator and when they say administer oh my gosh we're all running around like oh it's the big boss we got to rtca document (“document order”) it and so I would go around down the hall and I'd find my people and I would say drop everything you're doing we have to have this done by the end of the day how many times you're gonna find when you go around out into the real world or those of you that are in the real world now it's drop everything got to get this done right now it happens all the time well it was my last day at work and I got that same phone call you know I've already had my going-away party and I turned in my badge I'm all done 4:30 that afternoon I'm out of there I'm unemployed well we got that same phone call and it happened to be a three-day weekend and so everybody's getting out a little bit early you know they've got their hours and so they're running around and they're getting how they're about three o'clock so but it hardware accomplishment summary to get done so I'm there working with a couple folks and they're kind of antsy to get out of there so I let them go around and I'm gonna finish it up before I leave last stage on the job well I'm sitting there with it and I'm working on it and about 4:30 every day I get a call from my wife it's pretty much what I expected and usually is something goes something like this ah hey honey um what time you're gonna be home tonight oh well I'm working on this I got this to finish up I should be out normal time which would be around 5:00 o'clock that should get me home about 5:30 oh great well I hope you had a good day I know it's your last day I'll see you when you get home well 5:30 quarter six rolls around and I'm not home my wife calls me where you at well you called my office phone you know where I'm at I'm in the office obviously well she says well I thought you were gonna be home at 5:30 I planned dinner for six and I said I understand I said I'm sorry I just got this time flew away I got about 20 20 30 minutes to go around and I'll be done I promise I'll be home by 6:30 all right no problem I'll see you when you get here well 6:30 rolls around quarter seven I'm still not home and I'm still at work my wife calls me she's not very happy this time and the conversation wasn't nearly as polite but in a nutshell what she basically said she said hey you're not employed anymore what are you doing everybody's gone come home I'm like well but I gotta get this less I'm almost there I just got hung up the computer messed up a little bit I'm just about finished 30 minutes I'll be out here I promise you sis Scott and for the first time in my adult life and my marriage I was really listening to my wife because she said something she said this multiple times before but this time it really hit me and this is something I really want you to think about she said Scott well the world stopped spinning if you don't get this done you know I thought about that for a minute and I thought what am i doing everybody is gone you could hear crickets in the hallway it's so quiet because everybody's gone for the vacation the three-day weekend and I'm still here and I'm unemployed I'm not getting paid well I felt terribly guilty I wrote a note to my boss say Dave sorry I couldn't get this done you know I got almost all the done I hate to leave this you know I hate leaving snakes in the drawer you know sort of thing and but I I just it was silly why was I still there at seven o'clock so I left it and I worried about it all weekend long Monday morning rolls around I call up Dave Dave Dave hey did you get my note oh yeah I got it no problem I said oh man I am so sorry leaving you I know there's probably about another hours worth of work if you can have Carla or Kali or somebody work on that I'm sure they can wrap up subscribe what are you doing don't worry about it go around to Clemson enjoy your life this is not a big deal why rtca document (“document order”) you rtca document (“document order”) this to yourself I said well you know I said I'd get it done and I I feel really bad he says who cares I realized that what really was going on was this basically what was happening is the previous week somebody in the hallway the mystery might have been having just a conversation and said you know I've always wondered how many Cessna 172s actually rtca document (“document order”) crash in southwest region man I I'm curious I wonder and someone heard that oh I'm gonna get that for the administrator because they're trying to move up to on the pecking order and as a result they go around to their the person works for them says hey get me the numbers for 172s in southwest region of the christ' between 1995 and 2000 and then they go around to their person beneath them and who goes through the examine each time it gets elevated in all my gosh is for so and so it's oh my gosh would be four by the time it gets to me in Oklahoma three days later this thing is huge when in fact it really wasn't a big deal and as a result I'm pushing my people harder than I've ever pushed them and as a result sometimes to the breaking point I would ask you ask yourself how important it really is rtca document (“document order”) we really have to rtca document (“document order”) it today we don't rtca document (“document order”) that as management we always just yes sir yes sir let's rtca document (“document order”) it the truth is sometimes it isn't that important and sometimes we have to look at the risk and the consequences the other thing is overt asking and this is another one that's a very easy one to fall prey to basically and the example I give is as a manager when I would have I had those three semi people working for me and I can tell you I had five people working for me no matter what I asked him to rtca document (“document order”) they would rtca document (“document order”) it better than you could ever imagine I could have them I could say listen I need you guys to go around to my house I want you to go around into my backyard I want you to find 10 piles of dog poop and I want you to roll them into little balls and I want you to bring them back and show me what you have now that's a pretty nasty task right well those people would they would rtca document (“document order”) it they wouldn't say a word absolutely no problem I'll be back in about an hour and then go around to my house and they would roll them prettiest little dog poop balls you if I asked for ten they'd give me 20 and they'd be so pretty you could put them on your shelf I mean I'm making this up but the point is these people did anything you asked him to rtca document (“document order”) and they not only did it well they did it better than well they not only gave you what you asked for but they gave you more and if it meant they had to stay after work they didn't complain they just did it you didn't ask him they just did it they were those high achievers those people that everybody loves to have as an employee and then I had the other five at the other end that everybody hates these are the curmudgeons these are the people that didn't like me didn't like their job no matter what I did they weren't going to be happy those people I don't know I don't even know if they liked breathing they just weren't happy people and nobody likes to work with them and then I had the other 20 or so in the middle that were great employees did their job continuing airworthines management exposition to work at 8:00 they left at 4:30 they didn't take any work home they didn't stay late but they did while they were there they worked hard and they did a great job but they didn't go around above and beyond so when I would interview managers for jobs I would ask two very important questions after laying that scenario out with the top five the bottom five in the middle 20 the first question I would ask him was pretty easy if you have a job that absolutely must get done and done well who are you gonna give it to it's pretty easy right the top five yeah that's why I give it to this is that's the easy answer let me give you the tough question if you have a job that's horrible nobody you want it kind of the equivalent of cleaning toilets I mean it's just a Wow it's a bad job but it's got to be done who are you gonna give it to now if you said I'm gonna give it to the bottom five because I don't like them anyways wrong answer wrong answer because you're gonna learn real quick if you have a union the G word it's called grievance they're going to make your life miserable they're going to report you they're going to say that you're singing with them out which you may have been doing but the truth is your life is there they won't get it done and it won't be done well and they're gonna make your life miserable who you're probably going to give it to the top five is you don't want to give it to the middle twenty because yeah you don't want to turn them into the curmudgeons and you know the top five won't complain they won't complain they'll get it done but here's where the fun starts because now the bonafide is not doing very much there may be juggling one maybe two balls the middle the middle group are juggling there two or three balls and then the top group is juggling not only their balls but the bottom groups balls so they're juggling five or six balls they're big they're multi tasking so let me ask you this if someone in the bottom five juggling there one or two balls drops the ball doesn't get the job done how does that make them feel they don't care in fact if they were juggling two balls so probably throw the other one on the ground too just for fun but what if someone from the top five who's juggling six seven balls and they drop one how rtca document (“document order”) they feel they practically decompensate they can't handle it they're so distraught and upset with themselves because they failed they don't fail they succeed these people are so tightly wound they want to rtca document (“document order”) well for you and then they just drop and you set them up not only did you set up the people at the bottom but just set up the people at the top and we get what we call burnout so that over tasking can lead to burnout or add an adverse mental state which can lead to bad decisions and other dropping balls this is a really bad situation well we also have the failed to correct no probs this is my own personal this one really gets me wrapped up and really upset because here what we're talking about are [Applause] people that we know shouldn't be there have you ever been I mean we all know that there's certain people that just you wonder how did they get here oh my goodness this person is scary they don't have a clue we've all met these people some of us have worked with them some of us had have had them wait on us at tables or whatever the fact is there are people that sometimes just shouldn't have that job I just continuing airworthines management exposition back off of a flight and we were flying internationally over to London and we had six stellar absolutely great flight attendants and one guy who just hated his job I mean this guy was was just nasty not friendly and I'm usually a jovial happy guy and this guy was not this guy was horrible how he got there I don't know but he didn't belong and he was he was really making the rest of the passengers very uncomfortable the truth is what rtca document (“document order”) you rtca document (“document order”) if you don't deal with those people it can lead to big-time problems you know you have to we have if if you have a pilot who doesn't have the ability to fly and we know right away if they what kind of talent they have then they shouldn't be pilots rtca document (“document order”) you want to go around to a surgeon a heart surgeon that's okay I tell my wife I you know I went to a traditional medical school University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston and every year they have ten hundred they bring in ten hundred new medical students about a hundred and ninety five of them will graduate and it's the second best school in Texas which is and they have a lot of medical schools there I mean this is a great medical school Southwestern is the best but UTMB is second and it's a fantastic Medical School if you graduate from you Tim B you're guaranteed to have a great slot and you're gonna rtca document (“document order”) very well however like any university they have their top people and they have their bottom people and the people at the very bottom of that class of 195 to graduates alive bottom fifteen I'm not sure I'd want them popping a pimple these people were not very good but let me tell you they're all medical doctors so you have to ask yourself I have always wondered why people when they when they go around into a physician they don't say well where'd you go around to if they went to some directional school some you know Southwest northern Louisiana State for for about something above a laundromat that would make me nervous and I kind of want to know I think I deserve to know if you're gonna rtca document (“document order”) open heart surgery on me where did you graduate in your class were you the top student or were you the bottom student I'd like to kind of know I want to rtca document (“document order”) a little research this problem my life's in his hands wouldn't you like to know how much experience those pilots have in the cockpit that's flying that commercial airliner you're gonna get on tomorrow yeah I'd like to know well we don't you're hoping that somebody that does see them as threatening or a safety hazard will say something and rtca document (“document order”) something about it that doesn't always happen as a result sometimes I go around to an accident scene I've got a dead pilot I can't talk to him unless you can communicate with the dead and I can't so I have to go around talk to their friends nothing's worse than hear somebody say oh we knew that was gonna happen that guy was an accident waiting to happen really did you tell anybody no well you didn't rtca document (“document order”) him any favors he's dead dad and he took about 20 people with him that's criminal so ask yourself what are you gonna rtca document (“document order”) would someone's not qualified for a position that hardware accomplishment summary that's very risky and hardware accomplishment summary safety consequences are you gonna rtca document (“document order”) anything about it if management doesn't it sets people up for failure finally we look at supervisor violations these are rare but they rtca document (“document order”) occur occasionally and what we're talking about here is supervisors who violate their own rules or supervisors who encourage people to break the rules for example supervisors that walk into a oh I don't know let's say I'm going out on a shop floor where everybody's required to wear their personal protective equipment their PPE they have to have their goggles after their helmet they have ever steel toed shoes they have certain they might even have a smock on or something to keep keep any kind of fragments from hitting them they they have their personal protective gear on but the boss is walking through tu-tu-tu-tu-tu he's not I'm not gonna mess up my hair with that helmet and hey I got these glasses these are fine I don't need the ones with the side shield I'm just after all I'm just coming through for five minutes just to wave and say howdy I've got my dress shoes on not my steel toed shoes what kind of an example are you setting I've oftentimes when I go around work with airlines and other other industry said they always want to you know give you the royal tour and in the US I can assure you you're never going to find yourself on a shop floor at an airline they're not going to take you out into the hangar and out onto the out onto the flight line because you have to have certain permissions to rtca document (“document order”) that but I can tell you in Europe I was walking out let's go around show you what what goes on over here in the hangar that's like really okay and then they'll come up l-let me introduce you to Joe and Joe's over here turn around she's on a on one of the engines that's gonna be flying maybe me or my family some other week and either hey how you doing oh hey Doc how's it going blah blah blah blah blah I'm distracting him from his job and that mate what if he forgot to put one of those nuts on and now the engine blows up this is a big deal so a lot of times software of unknown pedigree (sometimes used with humor …) supervisors don't even realize that they're breaking their own rules and they're setting bad examples and they're setting failures up the other one is and you'll see a lot of this there's a lot of pressure to get things done supervisors are under an immense amount of pressure to keep the schedule going and so it's not unusual to have a supervisor come in say I don't care how you get it done I want those ten widgets out the door by the end of the day I don't care what you have to rtca document (“document order”) but hey it takes it I don't I don't want to hear it don't want to hear it get it done you've just sanctioned every shortcut in the book and then when something goes wrong and they come back and say well well but the boss told me told me to get no matter what just get it done the boss would say well I didn't think he was gonna break all the rules rtca document (“document order”) it oh really just how did you expect him to get it done when you make statements like that people take them literally and consequently will get it done when you force them no one's going to stand up to the boss and go around not gonna happen today no no no especially if their jobs on the line supervisors have to be smarter than that sometimes we encourage people to break the rules and that's the sort of thing we're talking about so we have this unsafe supervision this what we'll call inadequate supervision planning appropriate activities failed to correct no problems and supervise your violation it's a whole large area of endeavor but I just kind of wanted to give you a quick overview of that finally I want to talk to you about organizational influences they're really three things we want to keep in mind one is resource management the other one is organizational climate and then finally operational process and let me just buy resource management what rtca document (“document order”) I mean it's not let me bear in mind what we're talking about here are people to very highest levels we're talking about the Admirals the generals we're talk about presidents vice presidents CEOs of companies the very highest of the board members these are the people at the very highest levels they're the decision-makers ultimately for an organization when I talk about resource pensioners the question I have for people is how does the organization manage it's human its monetary and it's equipment resources rtca document (“document order”) we hire the best people rtca document (“document order”) we hire enough people are we downsizing rtca document (“document order”) we have the right mix of people a lot of times you'll find that sometimes people hire people for the wrong reasons I just have to get it fill this position just needs to be filled I realized we don't have any good candidates but if I don't get I need it filled now we need warm bodies sometimes when money gets tight what are the first things that go around away well operations have to maintain at a high level so you know we still have to put the widgets out the door but what you'll end up seeing is people oftentimes will start cutting corners with safety training travel things that you can rtca document (“document order”) without but reduce the safety margin as a result now we're at risk for failure so by downsizing and reducing and caught excessive cost-cutting supervisors may have no choice but to put the knuckleheads on the job that may be all they're left with and or they have to overt ask people because I have to get the job done but I don't have enough people to rtca document (“document order”) it as a result people make mistakes so it's the fix at the pointy end of the spear is it the problem with the employee or maybe it's higher in the system at the organizational level if we just looked up and been a little smarter when we were downsizing or cutting our costs sometimes we have to be smarter than we are we don't think it through we don't look at the cascade of events that could take place organizational climate here we look at the policies the written and the unwritten it's the unwritten ones that are really interesting I mean let's face it every on every industry hardware accomplishment summary a policy says if you're too sick or too tired to rtca document (“document order”) your job that's what we have sick leave for take the day off in the airlines if you're too sick or too tired to fly you can request a relief pilot and you don't have to fly that's the policy but what's the practice don't ask a pilot if they're too sick or too tired to fly can they call and ask for a relief pilot and they'll kind of chuckle yeah maybe once in a career if you rtca document (“document order”) it the second time you're probably going to get called by the chief pilot and you're gonna have questions along the lines of are you really cut out for this job there probably won't be a third time how many of you haven't been sick three times in the last ten years we all have we've all been tired but if you're afraid for your job you show up anyways and that's a problem you know we look at the structure of an organization you know what is the structure where is where's the vice-president for safety this VP safety report directly to the CEO which would be a good thing or does the VP for safety report for the to the VP for ops in other words safety is reporting to operations and remember operations wants to get things out the door what a safeties job well let's get them out safely which usually means slow it down put safety procedures in place which which reduces the number of widgets we get out the door so they're in direct conflict so if you have a safety this head of safety working for the head of operations who rtca document (“document order”) you think wins yeah we look at the culture of the organization that the way we rtca document (“document order”) business what is our culture what is our what is the organization's kind of what who are they you know what is their makeup the way we rtca document (“document order”) things there is a Clemson way there's a culture here at Clemson that's very different than say the culture at Ohio State which is very different than the culture at Michigan or Nebraska everybody hardware accomplishment summary I mean we're a small public school with a kind of a small-town feel that's very different than if you go around down in Austin to the University of Texas it's a whole different feeling down there trust me I've been there so the cultures differ depending on where you're at and and what they the way they rtca document (“document order”) business finally we look at the operational process these are the procedures themselves does devised by the Oregon state organizations put procedures in place to carry out the policies because in a matter of speaking organizational climate is like our vision it's the vision of an organization this is our vision and to carry out that vision we have a process which includes things like procedures oversight from the very highest levels to the people at the top really know what's going on at the pointing of the spear in many organizations that's not the case in many organizations the top guy is completely divorced separated from the rest of the organization the top guys sometimes an accountant a CEO is a finance guy he's a bean counter this is a guy that's all about money but maybe didn't grow up maybe he's you know the CEO of airlines are not pilots generally most of them are not pilots did not grow up in the aviation industry they continuing airworthines management exposition from some other industry and now they're in charge of this one they don't really know the way things go around and they don't really get out there and touch the other people there's a really neat show on on on TV these days it's a reality show it's Undercover Boss where you have these these family-owned businesses or these large companies like oh I don't know Hertz rent-a-car or you know it might be they had the 1-800 flowers whoever those guys are or you know chuck-e-cheeses or so so you know McDonald's the CEO of McDonald's and what that CEO does is he goes undercover and he goes out into the into the world he goes out and and basically takes a job for a short period of time as a cook or as somebody that's going to take the money or work the the window when you're going through the drive-thru and he basically is going out there to get a sense of what his employees are going through and it's very revealing because they find things out that they never knew were going on some good some bad because they're actually embedded in the job and the people don't know he's the CEO and then at the end you know he reveals and he brings them up to their headquarters and says oh you're you know I learned so much and did it and there's all it's really a very fun show but the point I'm trying to make is that CEOs don't really know in some cases what's going on at the point of the Spirit and every one of those CEOs went I learned a lot there were things I didn't even know we're going on so rtca document (“document order”) people at the top really know what's going on at the bottom operations themselves sometimes organizations grow so fast that they outgrow their infrastructure they're buying up companies are doing things and as a result they don't have the people and the X in place to manage properly they're just expanding so fast so we look at these things so basically what we've got is organizational climate which is the vision of an organization operational process which is the processor that we're going to use to carry out the vision and then of course resource management or the resources we need to carry out the process so these are all three connected which all have some impact downstream as we go around through this model so basically the three modules I provided you are the face of human factors this is this is what human factors is now is this perfect no no is it used by lots of folks absolutely and they modified here and there they change the name here and there which is no big deal it's the principle it's the fundamental philosophy of this that seems to be resonating in the industry so I wanted to give you this as kind of an introduction to human factors as an overview obviously there's a lot more detail and we get into that in our human factors class and some of the other classes that I teach but I wanted to give you a sense that there is some structure to it from an engineering point of view it's tangible we can put our hands on most of this and we can understand it and if you understand this you can predict human error and you can improve safety all right we'll see in the next module.

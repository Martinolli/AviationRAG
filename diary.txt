Project: Aviation RAG System Update

Today's Accomplishments:

1. Updated Corpus Generation:
   - Modified the script to include new fields: 'metadata' and 'category' in the document structure.
   - Generated a new corpus using the updated scripts.
   - Saved the new corpus as a JSON file for easier inspection and manipulation.

2. Chunking Process Update:
   - Modified the 'aviation_chunk_saver.py' script to accommodate the new document structure.
   - Updated the chunking routine to include 'metadata' and 'category' fields in the output.
   - Successfully generated new chunks based on the updated corpus.
   - Verified that the new fields (metadata and category) are present in the generated chunks.

3. Data Verification:
   - Checked the newly generated chunks to confirm the presence of the additional fields.
   - Ensured that the chunking process maintained the integrity of the original data while incorporating the new structure.

4. Next Steps Identified:
   - Generate new embeddings based on the updated chunk structure.
   - Update the AstraDB database to reflect the changes in the data structure.

5. Encountered DVC Configuration Issue:
   - Received an error related to DVC remote configuration.
   - Identified the need to set up a proper remote storage for DVC.

Overall, today's work significantly improved the data structure of our Aviation RAG system, laying the groundwork for more contextual and category-aware processing in the future stages of the project.

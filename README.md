# Aviation RAG Projec

## Aviation RAG Purpose

### The aeronautical community and industry are complex. The journey from a simple idea to design, manufacture, assembly, and flight is long. Today, the industry requires connections between different countries and resources and relies on electronic communication to keep this system functioning accurately. The amount of data, information, and decisions involved in the initial stages of a project through to its final release is substantial, significantly influencing safety outcomes. In aviation, safety is not just a set of practices but a reflection of behaviors and culture; it must be integrated into the core of aviation thinking. Given the intricate landscape of components, systems, and regulations, fostering a robust safety culture is crucial. As the extent of data, processes, and information continues to expand, decision-making becomes more complex. However, recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enhanced our ability to manage and analyze vast amounts of information. These models find application across various sectors, including healthcare, education and training, cybersecurity, financial services, military operations, and human resources, ultimately leading to improved decision-making and outcomes. Large Language Models (LLMs) are not just tools for marketing and sales; they are capable of understanding language on a massive scale. These models utilize extensive training processes to absorb vast amounts of text, allowing them to predict sentences effectively. LLMs have a wide range of applications and are transforming how we enhance human productivity, particularly in strategic thinking that requires the integration of analyses from various fields. In the aviation industry, for example, LLMs can play a pivotal role during the early stages of system development. They help address critical questions related to materials, systems, suppliers, assembly line methods, operational environments, and other essential variables that must be considered to finalize the design and define the system. Numerous issues may arise throughout this process that require systematic solutions. It's important to emphasize that human performance is a crucial element of this endeavor. We must remember that all processes are interconnected, and human performance plays a crucial role in determining the best ways to achieve goals. In this context, problems should be analyzed with the understanding that every part is linked and that there are no insignificant variables that can be overlooked. Addressing all relevant factors is essential to ensure the safety of system operations in both the civil aviation industry and the military aviation or defense sectors. With this perspective in mind, an important theory that enhances our understanding is the model developed by Mr. James Reason known as the Swiss Cheese Model. This model was later adapted by the Department of Defense (DoD) and led to the creation of the HFACS taxonomy. This framework takes an organizational approach to identify errors and problems, considering the organization as well as the environment in which this complex system operates. It emphasizes the interplay between human decision-making and performance. In this context, the idea of using a large language model (LLM) tool is to support the identification of gaps or deficiencies in this complex system. It acts as an auxiliary to human performance, helping to address issues that ensure outcomes comply with requirements and identify hidden triggers that could potentially lead to accidents or mishaps in the future, whether in the short or long term. This involves analyzing a non-conformance report related to a specific standard to verify if a task is well-defined and to check if the system functions properly during the early stages of design and testing. The use of an LLM model from the top down could be a breakthrough in the aviation industry, considering the actual stage of development necessary for safety operations. The LLM could be the tool used to bring the system safety analysis to the industry level, to treat the main processes as the engineering system treatment. The main objective of this project is to develop a prototype for an LLM tool tailored for the aviation industry. This tool aims to assist managers in evaluating possible alternatives to address initial problems while considering the impact on the final product. It will provide managers with a holistic perspective, as required by the industry's increasing complexity.

## Aviation RAG Project Composition

### The ARAG is composed of several different elements

1. AviationDOC folder
2. AviationRAG folder

#### AviationDOC Folder

    The ADOC Folder contains the following scripts and functions:
    - Chunked_documents Folder - where the chunked documents are stored to be used by the ARAG.
    - Data Folder - where the documents are stored, the documents are the raw data in "PDF" or "DOC" format to be treated and become part of "documents.pkl file" as a corpus document.
    - env Folder.
    - ProcessedText Folder - where the processed texts are stored.
    - Abbreviations.csv file - contains the abbrevations processed during the documents processing.
    - aviation_chunk_saver.py script - this script creates chunks from the processed documents by read_documents_to_txt.py script.
    - chunking.log File.
    - documents.pkl File - contains all documents processed by read_documents_to_txt.py script.
    - read_documents_to_txt script - this script reads the documents stored in the Data Folder, transform them into "TXT" file, clean the documents, create tokens, and prepare them for the chunk processing.
    - requirements.txt file - sotore the python packages required for the processing routines.
    - Data_1 Folder - contains documents to be processed before they will be stored in the Data Folder, for a previously analysis of size and characteristics.

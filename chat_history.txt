User: What are the steps to perform a System Hazard Analysis?
AI: AI: Performing a System Hazard Analysis (SHA) involves several steps. It is a crucial part of the system safety assessment process, especially in the aviation industry. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. **System Description**: Begin by providing a detailed description of the system, including its purpose, functionalities, operating conditions, and limitations.

2. **Identify Hazards**: This involves identifying potential hazards that could occur in the system. Hazards can be anything that has the potential to cause harm. In aviation, this could be a failure in the aircraft's engine, electrical system, navigational system, etc.

3. **Determine Causes**: For each identified hazard, determine and list the possible causes. This can involve system malfunctions, human errors, environmental factors, etc.

4. **Evaluate Risk**: Evaluate the risk associated with each identified hazard. This includes determining the severity and likelihood of each hazard. Severity refers to the potential impact of the hazard, while likelihood refers to the probability of the hazard occurring.

5. **Risk Reduction**: Identify ways to reduce the risk associated with each hazard. This can involve implementing safety measures, changing procedures, adding redundancies, etc.

6. **Documentation**: Document all the steps of the SHA, including the identified hazards, their causes, the evaluated risks, and the risk reduction measures. This documentation will be crucial for communicating the SHA to others and for future reference.

It should be noted that the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) in the United States and the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) have their own guidelines regarding SHA. For instance, the FAA's System Safety Process Steps (SSPS) provides a comprehensive process for conducting a SHA, as detailed in its Advisory Circular (AC) 23.1309-1E. 

Remember, the goal of the SHA is to ensure that risks are identified, evaluated, and mitigated to an acceptable level to ensure safety in flight operations. It is an ongoing process and should be reviewed and updated as the system changes or as new information becomes available.

User: Can you provide a Risk Matrix as a template, with 5 levels for Likelyhood (Qualitative) and five levels of severity?
AI: AI: Sure, here's a basic risk matrix template you can consider. It's a 5x5 matrix, with 5 levels of likelihood and 5 levels of severity:

|     | **Severity** |
| --- | --- |
|     | Negligible (1) | Marginal (2) | Critical (3) | Catastrophic (4) | Hazardous (5) |
| **Likelihood** | 
| Certain (5)  | Low Risk | Medium Risk | High Risk | Extreme Risk | Extreme Risk |
| Likely (4)   | Low Risk | Medium Risk | Medium Risk | High Risk | Extreme Risk |
| Possible (3) | Low Risk | Low Risk | Medium Risk | High Risk | High Risk |
| Unlikely (2) | Low Risk | Low Risk | Medium Risk | Medium Risk | High Risk |
| Rare (1)     | Low Risk | Low Risk | Low Risk | Medium Risk | High Risk |

Here's what each category represents:

- **Severity**: 
    - Negligible (1): No injury, health or system damage.
    - Marginal (2): Minor injury, minor system damage.
    - Critical (3): Severe injury, severe system damage.
    - Catastrophic (4): Major injuries or death, major system damage.
    - Hazardous (5): Multiple deaths, total system loss.
  
- **Likelihood**:
    - Certain (5): Event will occur in most circumstances.
    - Likely (4): Event will probably occur in most circumstances.
    - Possible (3): Event might occur at some time.
    - Unlikely (2): Event could occur at some time.
    - Rare (1): Event may only occur in exceptional circumstances.

Each risk level (Low, Medium, High, Extreme) implies a different course of action based on FAA or ICAO guidelines. Low risk might just require monitoring, Medium risk might require specific management or mitigation plans, High risk would typically require immediate action to mitigate, and Extreme risk might require ceasing of operations until the risk is addressed. 

Remember that this is a generic template and can be adapted to the specific requirements of your SHA. The definitions of likelihood and severity, as well as the thresholds for risk, should be tailored to your specific operation and risk tolerance.

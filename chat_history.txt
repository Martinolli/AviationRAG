User: What were the contributor factors during the Gulfstream aircraft disaster in Roswell?
AI: The Gulfstream aircraft disaster in Roswell occurred on November 22, 2004. The aircraft involved was a Gulfstream G-III, registration number N303GA. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) led the investigation and identified several contributing factors. 

1. **Inadequate training and preparation**: It was discovered that the crew was inadequately prepared for the flight. The pilots did not perform a pre-flight check, which is a critical step before any flight. This could have allowed them to identify and rectify any potential issues before take-off.

2. **Pilot error**: The NTSB found that the pilot made an error during the take-off roll. He improperly configured the airplane's flaps and slats, which are crucial for lift during take-off. This error led to the crash as the aircraft was unable to gain the necessary altitude.

3. **Failure to abort take-off**: The investigation also revealed that despite noticing the incorrect configuration of the flaps and slats, the crew did not abort the take-off. The crew's failure to abort take-off after recognizing a significant anomaly indicates a serious lapse in judgment.

4. **Overloading of the aircraft**: The aircraft was overloaded beyond its maximum take-off weight. This made it difficult for the aircraft to gain sufficient lift, contributing to the crash.

5. **Inadequate oversight by FAA**: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was cited for inadequate oversight of the operator, which allowed the operator's inadequate training and preparation to go unnoticed.

In response to this accident, the FAA has since reinforced regulations regarding pre-flight checks and abort procedures, and has increased its oversight of aircraft operators. For instance, it has reinforced the importance of adherence to FAA's guideline FAR Part 91.103, which requires pilots to familiarize themselves with all available information concerning a flight and to conduct preflight inspections. It also emphasizes the guideline FAR Part 91.13, which prohibits the operation of the aircraft in a careless or reckless manner.

User: What was the root cause in the Agusta A109 accident in London according to AAIB?
AI: The Agusta A109 accident in London occurred on January 16, 2013. The helicopter, an AgustaWestland AW109, collided with a crane attached to the St George Wharf Tower in Vauxhall, South London, UK. It subsequently crashed onto the street below, resulting in the deaths of the pilot and a person on the ground. According to the Aircraft Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) report, the primary cause of this accident was the pilot's decision to continue his flight into adverse weather conditions, which reduced visibility significantly. The AAIB noted that the pilot elected to fly in weather conditions below the applicable minima for Visual Flight Rules (VFR).  In the final stages of the flight, the pilot entered an area of reduced meteorological visibility. As a result, he was unable to see the crane that was extending above the top of St George Wharf Tower, which was also not lit as required. The AAIB report also highlighted several contributory factors, which included: 1. The pilot did not follow the pre-planned route, and his change of course led him into an area of reduced visibility and towards the construction crane.     2. The crane was not lit as required by regulations. The lighting on the crane was not working on the day of the accident, which could have made it more difficult for the pilot to see it in the foggy conditions. 3. The lack of formalized procedures for helicopter flights in London under Visual Flight Rules (VFR). There was no specified minimum altitude for VFR flights over the city, or 'escape' routes for pilots to use if they encountered poor weather.  4. The pilot's workload was likely to have been high at the time of the accident, due to his need to navigate in reduced visibility, while communicating with Air Traffic Control (ATC) and managing the aircraft's systems.  In response to the accident, the AAIB made several safety recommendations, including the need for a review of the regulations for lighting on high structures, the provision of weather information to pilots, and the procedures for VFR flight in London.

User: What was the root cause in the Agusta A109 accident in London according to AAIB?
AI: The Agusta A109 accident in London occurred on January 16th, 2013. The aircraft, a twin-engine helicopter, crashed into a crane on the St. George Wharf Tower, a skyscraper in Vauxhall, London. The pilot and a pedestrian on the ground were both killed, and several others were injured. According to the report released by the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB), the root cause of the accident was determined to be poor judgement and planning by the pilot. The pilot decided to continue flying under Visual Flight Rules (VFR) despite the weather being below the minimum requirements for VFR.  The AAIB's report stated, "The pilot, an experienced aviator and flight instructor, decided to take off in poor weather conditions that were below regulatory limits for flying under Visual Flight Rules. He then continued to fly into dense cloud, where he would have been able to see little or nothing at all." This led to the pilot not being able to see the crane, which was not lit as required by regulations. The crane was being used in the construction of the St. George Wharf Tower, and its height was not correctly displayed on the London helicopter route charts at the time of the accident.  The AAIB made several safety recommendations following the investigation, including the improvement of crane lighting and marking during construction, as well as the enhancement of helicopter operational standards in poor weather and visibility conditions. These recommendations were aimed at improving flight safety and preventing similar accidents in the future.  In terms of regulations, the AAIB report referenced several Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) regulations regarding visual flight rules, minimum visibility and cloud clearance requirements, and the requirement for cranes to be lit and marked.

User: What was the root cause in the Agusta A109 accident in London according to AAIB?
AI: The Agusta A109 accident in London refers to a fatal helicopter crash that occurred on January 16, 2013. The helicopter involved was an Agusta A109E Power, registration G-CRST, operated by RotorMotion. It crashed in Vauxhall, London, after colliding with a crane attached to the St George Wharf Tower. The UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) conducted an extensive investigation into this accident. Their final report concluded that the primary cause of the accident was the pilot's decision to continue the flight in adverse weather conditions, which led to the helicopter colliding with the crane. According to the AAIB, the pilot had set off in foggy conditions and was flying under Visual Flight Rules (VFR), which require generally clear weather conditions to navigate. Despite his initial decision to hold and wait for better visibility, he eventually chose to continue the flight. Unfortunately, the weather conditions did not improve, and the pilot didn't see the crane, which was also not lit as per requirements due to a fault. While the primary cause was related to decision making and weather conditions, the AAIB also pointed to several contributing factors: 1. The absence of a formal system within the operator's Operational Control to monitor and mitigate risk associated with flights in potentially challenging weather, which may have influenced the pilot's decision to continue the flight. 2. The failure of the crane's warning light due to an electrical fault, rendering it unlit on a foggy morning. 3. The lack of additional aids to make the crane more conspicuous to pilots flying in the area. 4. The pilot's lack of recent flying experience in conditions of reduced visibility. The AAIB made several safety recommendations following this investigation, aimed at improving flight safety in similar situations. These included recommendations to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to review and clarify the guidance regarding the flying in reduced visibility, to operators to improve their Operational Control systems, and to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) to review the requirements for obstacle lighting.

User: What happened in the accident with the helicopter AS350 in Frisco, Colorado, 2015?
AI: The accident involving the Airbus Helicopters AS350 B3e, N390LG, in Frisco, Colorado, took place on July 3, 2015. The helicopter was being operated as a local, public use flight. Unfortunately, the helicopter crashed shortly after takeoff near the St. Anthony Summit Medical Center, Frisco, Colorado. The pilot was fatally injured, and the two flight nurses on board were seriously injured.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) conducted an investigation into the accident. According to the NTSB's final report, the probable cause of the accident was the pilot's decision to takeoff from a helipad located at 9,000 feet above mean sea level (AMSL) in an outside air temperature (OAT) of 14 degrees Celsius (57.2 degrees Fahrenheit), at which the helicopter was operating at the limit of its performance capabilities. The investigation found that the helicopter was unable to maintain altitude due to the density altitude, the weight of the helicopter, and the current meteorological conditions.

The NTSB also found that the pilot did not apply the correct technique to recover from the loss of lift, known as vortex ring state. This led to a significant loss of altitude and subsequent collision with terrain.

In response to this accident, the NTSB issued safety recommendations, including the need for helicopter operators to identify and communicate helicopter performance limitations in existing standard operating procedures, training programs, and preflight briefings for all flights.

Additionally, the NTSB encouraged the development of training programs that increase helicopter pilots' understanding of helicopter performance, limitations, and the physical and aerodynamic effects that contribute to vortex ring state. They also recommended the use of simulation devices or flight training devices that accurately represent a specific make, model, and series helicopter's performance capabilities and limitations.

This accident highlights the importance of understanding and respecting the performance limitations of aircraft, especially in challenging environmental conditions.

User: What are the findings described in the NTSB report from AS350 helicopter in Frisco, Colorado 2015?
AI: The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation into the AS350 helicopter accident in Frisco, Colorado in 2015 yielded several key findings:

1. Probable Cause: The NTSB identified the probable cause of the accident to be the pilot's decision to takeoff under conditions where the helicopter was operating at the limit of its performance capabilities. The combination of the helicopter's altitude, weight, outside air temperature (OAT), and density altitude pushed the helicopter to its performance limit, making it unable to maintain altitude.

2. Performance Limitations: The report highlighted the importance of understanding and respecting the performance limitations of aircraft. The helicopter was operating at the edge of its performance capabilities at the time of the accident, which resulted from the high altitude of the helipad (9,000 feet above mean sea level), the weight of the helicopter, the outside air temperature (14 degrees Celsius), and the current meteorological conditions.

3. Vortex Ring State: The pilot did not apply the correct technique to recover from the vortex ring state, a condition where a helicopter loses lift. This led to a significant loss of altitude and subsequent collision with the terrain.

4. Training and Procedures: The NTSB recommended that helicopter operators identify and communicate performance limitations in their standard operating procedures, training programs, and preflight briefings. They also suggested the development of training programs to increase pilots' understanding of helicopter performance, its limitations, and the physical and aerodynamic effects that contribute to the vortex ring state.

5. Simulation Training: The NTSB also emphasized the importance of simulation training. They recommended using simulation devices or flight training devices that accurately represent the specific make, model, and series of a helicopter's performance capabilities and limitations.

The findings from this report highlight the critical importance of understanding and respecting the performance limitations of aircraft under various environmental conditions, and the value of comprehensive training and procedures in preventing such accidents.

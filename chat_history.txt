User: Tell me about part 5 Safety Management System, 5.1 from cfr 14 FAA
AI: Part 5 of the CFR 14 (Code of Federal Regulations) from the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) is dedicated to the Safety Management System (SMS). SMS is a formal, top-down, organization-wide approach to managing safety risk and assuring the effectiveness of safety risk controls. 

Section 5.1, specifically, is about the "Applicability and Description of SMS". This section indicates that the regulations and guidelines of the SMS apply to all holders of the following certificates: 
- Air carrier operating certificates
- Operating certificates
- Management specifications
- Certain airport operating certificates
- FAA-approved airport operating certificates
- Air agency certificates
- FAA-approved air agency certificates
- Certain organization designation authorizations

The section also describes the four key components of the SMS:

1. **Safety Policy**: This outlines the organization's approach to managing safety, including the safety objectives and the roles and responsibilities of employees in achieving these objectives.

2. **Safety Risk Management (SRM)**: This involves identifying hazards in the operational environment, assessing the risks associated with these hazards, and implementing measures to mitigate these risks.

3. **Safety Assurance (SA)**: This involves processes that ensure the organization's safety risk controls achieve the intended objectives and that the organization meets or exceeds its safety objectives through the collection, analysis, and assessment of information.

4. **Safety Promotion**: This involves training, communication, and other actions to create a positive safety culture within the organization.

In terms of guidelines, FAA's AC 120-92B provides details on how to implement an SMS based on the requirements of Part 5. This AC (Advisory Circular) provides guidance for operators who choose to implement an SMS, based on international standards for SMS developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The AC explains system safety concepts that underlie SMS, the four components of an SMS, and the process for implementing an SMS. It also contains guidance on developing an SMS implementation plan. 

Please note that the specifics might vary depending on the size of the organization and the nature of its activities.

User: What is described in the session 5.1 from 14 CFR Part 5 Safety Management System?
AI: The 14 CFR Part 5, section 5.1 of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines refers to the "Applicability" of the Safety Management System (SMS). Although I don't have the exact text, typically, this section of a regulation would specify the entities to which the regulation applies.

For instance, it might specify that it applies to holders of certain types of certificates, or operators of certain types of aircraft, or organizations that conduct certain types of operations. 

In the case of the 14 CFR Part 5, the SMS regulations apply to certificate holders with an approved SMS, as well as applicants for, and holders of, a type certificate, including a supplemental type certificate, a parts manufacturer approval, or a production certificate under Part 21.

Please note that you should refer to the actual regulation for the complete and official requirements as the specifics might vary.

User: What is the definition for Hazard and Risk, according to the CFR Part 5 Safety Management 
AI: According to the 14 CFR Part 5, a "Hazard" is defined as a condition that could foreseeably cause or contribute to an aircraft accident. This could be anything from mechanical failure, to poor weather conditions, to human error.

On the other hand, "Risk" is defined as the composite of predicted severity and likelihood of the potential effect of a hazard. It is usually quantified by the Risk Assessment Matrix that combines the severity of potential consequences with the likelihood of occurrence. 

For example, a hazard could be a malfunctioning landing gear. The risk associated with this hazard could be assessed as high, medium, or low depending on various factors such as the type of terrain for landing, the speed of the aircraft, the availability of emergency services, and so on. 

Remember, these definitions are used to help identify and manage potential safety issues within the aviation industry, and are a key part of any Safety Management System (SMS).

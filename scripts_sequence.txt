Explanation of re.findall(r'\b[Pp]art\s\d+\b', text)
📌 Breakdown of the Regular Expression Pattern:

re.findall(r'\b[Pp]art\s\d+\b', text)

Component	Explanation
re.findall(...)	Extracts all matches of the pattern from text.
r''	Raw string notation, ensuring that \ characters are treated as literal.
\b	Word boundary, ensures it matches a whole word and not part of another word.
[Pp]	Matches uppercase or lowercase 'P', allowing both "Part 91" and "part 121".
art	Matches the exact word "art", ensuring the full word "Part" is captured.
\s	Matches a space character (" "), ensuring "Part" is followed by a space.
\d+	Matches one or more digits (0-9), capturing numbers like "91" or "121".
\b	Word boundary again, ensuring "Part 121" is matched as a whole word, not part of "Part121XYZ".

Expected Matches:

Text Sample	Captured Match
"Refer to Part 91 regulations."	"Part 91"
"The requirements are in part 121."	"part 121"
"Follow part 135 or part 145."	"part 135", "part 145"
"This is not Part121."	❌ (No match, missing space)

🚀 How to Use It? If you want to extract "Part 91", "part 121", etc., from a document, you can use:

python
Copy
Edit

part_references = re.findall(r'\b[Pp]art\s\d+\b', text)
print(part_references)  

['Part 91', 'part 121']

2️⃣ File Naming Strategy – Is "14cfr_safety_management_system" Good?
✅ Your current pattern is good because:

It uses underscores (_) instead of spaces (✔ No whitespace issues).
It is descriptive: "14cfr_safety_management_system" is clear.
It follows a consistent format.
🚀 Suggestions for Improvement You could enhance readability and maintainability by adding versioning or a standardized structure:

Format	Example	Pros
YYYY-MM-DD_document_title	2024-02-26_14cfr_safety_management_system	Keeps files in chronological order.
Category_Title	Regulation_14CFR_Safety_Management_System	Groups similar documents together.
docID_Title_v1	FAA_14CFR_Safety_Management_v1	Useful for tracking versions.
💡 Best Practice:

If documents belong to the same category, add prefixes (e.g., "Regulation_", "AccidentReport_").
If files have multiple versions, add "v1", "v2", etc.
If files come from different sources (e.g., FAA, EASA, ICAO), consider adding "FAA_", "ICAO_".
